  "description_abstract": "Ultra-high performance concrete (UHPC) was evaluated as a potential material for future bridge deck designs.  Material characterization tests took place to identify potential challenges in mixing, placing, and curing UHPC.  Biaxial testing was performed to evaluate behavior of UHPC in combined tension and compression stress states.  A UHPC bridge deck was designed to perform similarly to a conventional concrete bridge deck, and a single unit bridge deck section was tested to evaluate the design methods used for untreated UHPC.    Material tests identified challenges with placing UHPC.  A specified compressive strength was determined for structural design using untreated UHPC, which was identified as a cost-effective alternative to steam treated UHPC.    UHPC was tested in biaxial tension-compression stress states.  A biaxial test method was developed for UHPC to directly apply tension and compression.  The influence of both curing method and fiber orientation were evaluated.  The failure envelope developed for untreated UHPC with random fiber orientation was suggested as a conservative estimate for future analysis of UHPC.  Digital image correlation was also evaluated as a means to estimate surface strains of UHPC, and recommendations are provided to improve consistency in future tests using DIC methods.  A preliminary bridge deck design was completed for untreated UHPC and using established material models.  Prestressing steel was used as primary reinforcement in the transverse direction.  Preliminary testing was used to evaluate three different placement scenarios, and results showed that fiber settling was a potential placement problem resulting in reduced tensile strength.  The UHPC bridge deck was redesigned to incorporate preliminary test results, and two single unit bridge deck sections were tested to evaluate the incorporated design methods for both upside down and right-side up placement techniques.  Test results showed that the applied design methods would be conservative for either placement method.",
