  "description_abstract": "The complex natural product paclitaxel (TaxolÂ®),  first isolated from Taxus brevifolia, is a member of a large family of taxane diterpenoids. Paclitaxel is extensively used for the treatment  of solid tumors, particularly those of the breasts and ovaries.  In order to obtain additional information about the mechanism of action of paclitaxel and the environment of the  paclitaxel-binding site, several fluorescent analogs of paclitaxel were  synthesized, and  their biological activities have been evaluated.  For the investigation of possible synergistic effects, concurrent modifications on selected positions have been performed and their biological evaluation were studied.",
