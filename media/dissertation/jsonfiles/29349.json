  "description_abstract": "A Case Study of the Implementation of Ernest Boyer's Basic School Framework in One Elementary School   Ray E. Van Dyke   (Abstract)   \tSchools often understand the need for change, but they need a unifying theme and body of knowledge to direct that change so that it is not done piecemeal.  The Basic School research of Ernest Boyer (1995) offers a potential solution for that problem by presenting a theoretical framework for school renewal and change.   \tThis study examines the experiences of one elementary school in implementing the Basic School framework.  The literature review covers the foundations underlying the Basic School philosophy as well as research that has been conducted since the original report.  The design of this study is a qualitative case study of one elementary school.  The collection and analysis of a field journal, field notes, participant observations, interviews, and documents culminate in a narrative account of findings and reflections. \tBy providing details of how one school applied the Basic School framework, this report offers insight into methods other elementary schools could use to more effectively design the implementation process for their settings.  The experiences of this school could therefore lead to the development of a model generalizable to other schools as they proceed with school renewal and change.",
