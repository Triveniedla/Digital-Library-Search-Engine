  "description_abstract": "As VLSI circuits continue to have more and more transistors over time, the question of not only how to use, but how to manage the complexity of so many transistors becomes increasingly important. Four hypothesis are given for the design of a system that scales-up as transistors continue to shrink. An architecture is presented that satisfies these hypothesis, and the motivation behind the hypothesis is further explained. The use of this architectureâ  s unique features to implement an efficient, defect-tolerant parallel bootstrap system is discussed. A detailed methodology for implementing this system in vivo is described. A sample problem â   simulation of heat flow â   is presented, and its solution using the proposed architecture is described in detail. A comparison is made between the proposed architecture and a set of contemporary architectures, and the former is shown to have desirable performance in a number of areas. Conclusion are given, and plans for future work are presented.",
