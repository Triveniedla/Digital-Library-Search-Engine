  "description_abstract": "The intent of this historical study is to document the change from the educational program known as Industrial Arts to what is now titled Technology Education. A synthesis of prior historiographical perspectives on the evolution of industrial arts, including some new information, provides a basis for understanding the more recent history that is the primary focus of this study. The portion of this study dealing with the transition to technology education explores the individuals, events, and other factors that compelled the movement to begin and the issues surrounding the acceptance of technology as the motive for the profession. The primary program and policy goals of technology education will be examined and concerns and projections will be expressed for the future of technology education.",
