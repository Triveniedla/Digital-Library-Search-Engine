  "description_abstract": "Online learners bring varied learning experiences depending on their different personal characteristics and traits. This descriptive and correlational study explored students\\' online satisfaction in relation to their locus of control orientation and their personal characteristics including gender, age, ethnicity, and online learning experiences. Responses were collected from students in an online course at Virginia Tech. Descriptive statistics, Pearson correlations and Multiple Linear Regression methods were used to detect the correlations and analyze the relationships among different variables. Results of the study did not find correlations between students\\' online satisfaction and their locus of control, as well as their personal characteristics. The results also showed that students\\' locus of control and personal characteristics did not contribute to students\\' online satisfaction.",
