  "description_abstract": "Modeling the Dynamic Interactions between Wood Pallets and Corrugated Containers during Resonance  Timothy G. Weigel  (ABSTRACT) \tThe unit load is the form of most commercial and industrial products during storage and distribution.  A simple form of a unit load, a palletized bulk bin is commonly used to transport fruit and vegetables from the point of harvest to processing facilities.  These vibration sensitive products are often subjected to damaging vibrations during this period.  Most damage occurs during the large accelerations associated with resonance, which occurs when the natural frequency of the unit load matches the input frequencies commonly encountered during transportation.  A computer model, called RoPUL (resonance of palletized unit loads), of a palletized bulk bin loaded with fruit, was developed using finite element analysis techniques.  Unit loads consisting of palletized bulk bins of apples and peaches were tested and RoPUL was found to accurately predict the resonant frequencies of these loads.  Using RoPUL, the effects of product mass, container design, and pallet design on natural frequencies can be analyzed.  As the input frequencies of most transportation modes is well documented, RoPUL can be used to help design a unit load to better protects vibration sensitive products during shipment.",
