  "description_abstract": "The purpose of this study was to examine complexities which constitute women√¢  s narratives in a conservative Christian church context.  Complexities often occur around self-perception, religious beliefs, choices and change, in regard to gender relations. A review of literature indicated that social constructions about gender influence the way individuals construct narratives and meaning about their lives, which inform them how to live.  Taking into account how reality is constructed though social dialogue an emphasis was placed on understanding how individuals conform and reform knowledge.  This is often accomplished through the use of language around cultural and personal narratives.",
