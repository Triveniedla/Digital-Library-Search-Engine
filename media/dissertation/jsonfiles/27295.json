  "description_abstract": "Hysteresis, defined as a rate independent memory  effect, is a phenomenon that occurs in many  physical systems.  The effect is sometimes  desired, sometimes a nuisance, sometimes cata- strophic, but in every case we must understand  hysteresis if we are to better understand the  system itself.    This work introduces a method of parameter  identification for the Preisach model of hyster- esis.  This identification method is explored in both the setting of non-singular measures and the setting of singular measures.",
