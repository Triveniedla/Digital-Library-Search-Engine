  "description_abstract": "This study proposes to blend contemporary educational research in order to design an online instructional environment.  The goal was to create an environment that would better educate learners about grammar use in higher education, given the complexity of the rule learning that was being asked of them.  By blending approaches from tested educational research on cognitive information processing theories, schema theories, and situated cognitive theories in order to determine how language rules are best learned, eight design principles were derived for the instructional environment.  A prototype of the environment was then developed.  Two series of formative evaluations, one with a group of subject-matter experts (teachers, linguists, and instructional designers) and one with a group of students, were run against the instruction.  Overall, it was found that a database-driven website employing user-defined variables to customize the instruction for each individual user was a useful way to achieve the goals of the study.",
