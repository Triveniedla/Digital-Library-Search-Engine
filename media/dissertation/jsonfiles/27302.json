  "description_abstract": "This qualitative study was designed to explore the role of family in the life of African American college students at two predominately White institutions. Data were collected through in-depth interviews with 38 African American college students and members of their families.   The results revealed eight factors that influenced students' success and their ability to persist in college: (1) Family Support and Influence, (2) Sense of Community, (3) Family Investment and Expectations, (4) Negotiating Environments, (5) Role Models and Mentors, (6) Faith in God/Spiritual Support, (7) Factors of Motivation, and (8) Macro Cultural Perspectives on Race.",
