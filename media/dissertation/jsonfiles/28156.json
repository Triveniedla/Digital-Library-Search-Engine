  "description_abstract": "As one of the kernel components of ITS technology, Travel Time Estimation (TTE) has been a high-interest topic in highway operation and management for years. Out of numerous vehicle detection technologies being applied in this project, intrusive loop detector, as the representative of spot measurement devices, is the most common. The ultimate goal of this dissertation is to seek a TTE approach based primarily on spot speed measurement and capable of successfully performing in a certain accuracy range under various traffic conditions.  The provision of real-time traffic information could offer significant benefits for commuters looking to make optimum travel decisions. The proposed research effort attempts to characterize typical variability in traffic conditions using traffic volume data obtained from loop detectors on I-66 Virginia during a 3-month period. The detectors logged time-mean speed, volume, and occupancy measurements for each station and lane combination. Using these data, the study examines the spatiotemporal link and path flow variability of weekdays and weekends. The generation of path flows is made through the use of a synthetic maximum likelihood approach. Statistical Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) tests are performed on the data. The results demonstrate that in terms of link flows and total traffic demand, Mondays and Fridays are similar to core weekdays (Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Thursdays). In terms of path flows, Fridays appear to be different from core weekdays.  A common procedure for estimating roadway travel times is to use either queuing theory or shockwave analysis procedures. However, a number of studies have claimed that deterministic queuing theory and shock-wave analysis are fundamentally different, producing different delay estimates for solving bottleneck problems. Chapter 5 demonstrates the consistency in the delay estimates that are derived from both queuing theory and shock-wave analysis and highlights the common errors that are made in the literature with regards to shock-wave analysis delay estimation. Furthermore, Chapter 5 demonstrates that the area between the demand and capacity curves can represent the total delay or the total vehicle-hours of travel if the two curves are spatially offset and queuing theory has its advantages on this because of its simplicity.  As the established relationship between time-mean and space-mean speed is suitable for estimating time-mean speeds from space-mean speeds in most cases, it is also desired to estimate the space-mean speeds from time-mean speeds. Consequently, Chapter 6 develops a new formulation that utilizes the variance of the time-mean speed as opposed to the variance of the space-mean speed for the estimation of space-mean speeds. This demonstrates that the space-mean speeds are estimated within a margin of error of 0 to 1 percent. Furthermore, it develops a relationship between the space- and time-mean speed variance and between the space-mean speed and the spatial travel-time variance. In addition, the paper demonstrates that both the Hall and Persaud and the Dailey formulations for estimating traffic stream speed from single loop detectors are valid. However, the differences in the derivations are attributed to the fact that the Hall and Persaud formulation computes the space-mean speed (harmonic mean) while the Dailey formulation computes the time-mean speed (arithmetic mean).  Chapter 7 focuses on freeway Travel Time Estimation (TTE) algorithms that are based on spot speed measurements. Several TTE approaches are introduced including a traffic dynamics TTE algorithm that is documented in literature. This traffic dynamics algorithm is analyzed, highlighting some of its drawbacks, followed by some proposed corrections to the traffic dynamics formulation. The proposed approach estimates traffic stream density from occupancy measurements, as opposed to flow measurements, at the onset of congestion. Next, the study validates the proposed model using field data from I-880 and simulated data. Comparison of five different TTE algorithms is conducted. The comparison demonstrates that the proposed approach is superior to the TTE traffic dynamics approach. Particularly, a multi-link simulation network is built to test spot-speed-measurement TTE performance on multi links, as well as the data smoothing techniqueâ  s effect on TTE accuracy. Findings further prove advantages of utilizing space-mean speed in TTE rather than time-mean speed. In summary, a feasible TTE procedure that is adaptive to various traffic conditions has been established. Since each approach would under-/over-estimate travel time depending on the concrete traffic condition, different models will be selected to ensure TTEâ  s accuracy window. This approach has broad applications because it is based on popular loop detectors.",
