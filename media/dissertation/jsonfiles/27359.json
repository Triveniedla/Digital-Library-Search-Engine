  "description_abstract": "This dissertation examines between-brand price premiums from an information processing perspective.  A literature review is conducted in which price premiums are shown to depend on consumer√¢  s ability, motivation and opportunity to process information relevant to making between-brand judgments of value.  A conceptual model is developed that incorporates these three constraints on brand information processing, but focuses on the antecedents of the motivation construct.  An experiment is conducted that tests the effects on information processing of four antecedents to motivation:  involvement, brand evaluation motive, economic concern, and need for cognition.  Results show that involvement interacts with motive in its effect on information processing amount, but not on processing style. Need for cognition is positively related to both amount and style of processing, but the economic concern results were mixed.  Finally, implications of the results are discussed and future research directions suggested.",
