  "description_abstract": "The original Macdonald polynomials $P_\\mu$ form a basis for the vector space of symmetric functions which specializes to several of the common bases such as the monomial, Schur, and elementary bases. There are a number of different types of Macdonald polynomials obtained from the original $P_\\mu$ through a combination of algebraic and plethystic transformations one of which is the modified Macdonald polynomial $\\widetilde{H}_\\mu$. In this dissertation, we study a certain specialization $\\widetilde{F}_\\mu(q,t)$ which is the coefficient of $x_1x_2 ... x_N$ in $\\widetilde{H}_\\mu$ and also the Hilbert series of the Garsia-Haiman module $M_\\mu$. Haglund found a combinatorial formula expressing $\\widetilde{F}_\\mu$ as a sum of $n!$ objects weighted by two statistics. Using this formula we prove a $q,t$-analogue of the hook-length formula for hook shapes. We establish several new combinatorial operations on the fillings which generate $\\widetilde{F}_\\mu$. These operations are used to prove a series of recursions and divisibility properties for $\\widetilde{F}_\\mu$.",
