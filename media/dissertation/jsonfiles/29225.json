  "description_abstract": "Long wait times constitute a bottleneck limiting the number of compilation runs performed in a day, thus risking to restrict Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) adaptation in modern computing platforms. This work presents an FPGA development paradigm that exploits logic variance and hierarchy as a means to increase FPGA productivity. The practical tasks of logic partitioning, placement and routing are examined and a resulting assembly framework, Quick Flow (qFlow), is implemented. Experiments show up to 10x speed-ups using the proposed paradigm compared to vendor tool flows.",
