  "description_abstract": "A quantitative and qualitative study of the behavioral effects of an insecticide on various life stages of the German  cockroach, Blattella germanica (L.), was conducted. Comparisons between a susceptible laboratory strain (VPI)  and a resistant field strain (BP) were made to examine the relationship between physiological resistance and behavioral resistance.   The effects of vapors from a formulation of 1% propoxur in oil were compared with vapors from a mineral oil control.  Vapors from the control had little effect on cockroach behavior. Adult males, adult females, and middle instars were  repelled from aquaria containing the insecticide vapors.",
