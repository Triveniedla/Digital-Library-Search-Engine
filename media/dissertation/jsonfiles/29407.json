  "description_abstract": "<p>The purpose of this study was to conduct a concept analysis of middle school American history textbooks to determine the extent to which selected concepts are included. Specifically - this study concerned itself with the eighteen substantive concepts developed by the Syracuse University Social Studies Curriculum Center. These concepts were modeled and applied to selected textbooks in a concept analysis system. These concepts were used because of their applicability and utility over other concept groups.</p>",
