  "description_abstract": "Based on hypothesized relations advanced by Cummings and Davies (1995), the current study tests the hypothesis that parental availability and parental control, experienced during middle adolescence, relate to late adolescents창   adjustment through influence on their emotional security. The study also examines the role of late adolescents창   emotional intelligence and its relationship with parental behaviors, emotional security, and adolescents창   adjustment. This study proposes a model of relationships where emotional security and emotional intelligence influence each other and mediate the relationship between parental behaviors and late adolescents창   adjustment. Regression analyses show partial support for the hypotheses.",
