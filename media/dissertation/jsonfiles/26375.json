  "description_abstract": "This dissertation is devoted to investigating the time dependent neutron transport  equations with reflecting  boundary conditions. Two typical geometries --- slab geometry  and spherical geometry --- are considered in the setting of <I>L^p</I> including <I>L^1</I>. Some  aspects of the spectral properties of the transport operator <I>A</I> and the strongly  continuous semigroup <I>T(t)</I> generated by <I>A</I> are studied. It is shown under fairly  general assumptions that the accumulation points of { m Pas}(A):=sigma (A) cap  { lambda :{ m Re}lambda > -lambda^{ast} }, if they exist, could only appear on  the line { m Re}lambda =-lambda^{ast}, where lambda^{ast}  is the essential  infimum of the total collision frequency. The spectrum of <I>T(t)</I> outside the disk {lambda : |lambda| leq exp (-lambda^{ast} t)} consists of isolated eigenvalues  of <I>T(t)</I> with finite algebraic multiplicity, and the accumulation points of   sigma (T(t)) igcap{ lambda : |lambda| > exp (-lambda^{ast} t)}, if they  exist, could only appear on the circle {lambda :|lambda| =exp (-lambda^{ast} t)}.  Consequently, the asymptotic behavior of the time dependent solution is obtained.",
