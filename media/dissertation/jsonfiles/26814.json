  "description_abstract": "We discuss the physical problem of a molecule  interacting with an electromagnetic field pulse  and model the problem using a time-dependent perturbation of the Born-Oppenheimer approximation to the Schrodinger equation.  Using previous  results that develop asymptotic series solutions  in the Born-Oppenheimer parameter Îµ, we  derive a formal Dyson series expansion in the  perturbation parameter Î¼, which is  proportional to the electromagnetic field strength. We then prove that this series is asymptotically  accurate in both parameters, provided that the Hamiltonian for the electrons has purely discrete spectrum.  Under more general hypotheses, we show that the series is accurate to first order in  Î¼, and that it is accurate to one higher order if we place conditions on the abruptness of the  EM pulse.  We also show how this series  development provides a justification for the  Franck-Condon factors in the case of a diatomic  molecule.",
