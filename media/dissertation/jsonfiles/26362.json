  "description_abstract": "Intelligent transportation systems data collected on drivers who presumably participated in a study of cognitive mapping and way-finding were  evaluated with two basic procedures for data  coding, including analysis of video data based on  the occurrence or non-occurrence of a) critical  behaviors during consecutive 15 second intervals  of a driving trial, and b) the safe alternative  when a safe behavior opportunity was available.   Methods of data coding were assessed for practical use, reliability, and sensitivity to variation in driving style.  A factor analysis of at-risk  driving behaviors identified a cluster of  correlated driving behaviors that appeared to  share a common characteristic identified as  aggressive/impatient driving.  The relationship  between personality and driving style was also  assessed.  That is, analysis of the demographics  and personality variables associated with the  occurrence of at-risk driving behaviors revealed  that driver Age and Type A personality  characteristics were significant predictors of  vehicle speed and following distance to the  preceding vehicle.  Results are  discussed with regard to implications for safe  driving interventions and problem behavior theory.",
