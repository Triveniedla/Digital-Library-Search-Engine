  "description_abstract": "We examine discrete models with hexagonal symmetry  to compare the sequence of transitions with the  alpha-inc-beta phase transition of quartz. We  examine a model by Parlinski which employs  interactions of nearest and next-nearest neighbor  atoms. We numerically determine the configurations  which lead to minimum energy for a range of  parameters. We then use Golubitsky's results on  systems with hexagonal symmetry to derive the  bifurcation diagram for Parlinski's model. Finally,  we study a large class of modifications to  Parlinski's model and show that all such  modifications have the same bifurcation picture  as the original model.",
