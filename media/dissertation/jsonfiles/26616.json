  "description_abstract": "Studies have shown that effective principals are a key ingredient to high performing schools.  Studies also indicate that a shortage of effective administrators is looming and some contend that the shortage is here (Daresh & Capasso, 2002).  Johnson and Holdaway, 1991 report that it is important to study job satisfaction for many reasons.  They also contend that one of the reasons it is important to study job satisfaction is that job satisfaction is related to absenteeism as well as staff turnover.  <p> One way to address the shortage of effective administrators is to continually assess the job satisfaction of administrators to determine which aspects of the job affect satisfaction.  In this study, the researcher examined the job satisfaction of high school principals in the Commonwealth of Virginia in 2008.  A replication of procedures used by Dr. James Stemple in 2004 provided the opportunity to compare results with Stempleâ  s study to determine if the job satisfaction of high school principals has changed since 2004.  Dr. Stempleâ  s study was one of the first studies to assess job satisfaction after the implementation of the accountability movement.   <p> However, federal accountability including Adequate Yearly Progress has risen considerably since Stempleâ  s 2004 study.   In 2004, a pass rate of 65% for reading and 63% for math was required in order for a school to make AYP.  During the 2008-2009 school year the required passing rate is 81% for reading and 79% for math.  This study assessed job satisfaction of high school principals through the lens of the federal and state accountability movements.",
