  "description_abstract": "Generalized hill climbing (GHC) algorithms provide a unifying framework for describing several discrete optimization problem local search heuristics, including simulated annealing and tabu search. A necessary and a sufficient convergence condition for GHC algorithms are presented.   <p> The convergence conditions presented in this dissertation are based upon a new iteration classification scheme for GHC algorithms. The convergence theory for particular formulations of GHC algorithms is presented and the implications discussed. Examples are provided to illustrate the relationship between the new convergence conditions and previously existing convergence conditions in the literature. The contributions of the necessary and the  sufficient convergence conditions for GHC algorithms are discussed and future research endeavors are suggested.",
