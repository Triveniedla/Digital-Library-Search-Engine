  "description_abstract": "This research focuses on experimental investigations of the drying and bending properties of wood flakes.  Three species (southern yellow pine, sweetgum, and yellow-poplar) were tested.  Experiments on flake drying and effect of flake properties (cutting direction and dimension) and an external factor (temperature) were used to evaluate the flake drying process.  Drying experiments were conducted using a convection oven.  Bending properties of dried flakes were also measured.  Modulus of elasticity (MOE), modulus of rupture (MOR), and strength at proportional limit (SPL) of flakes were measured based on Methods of Testing Small Clear Specimens of Timber (ASTM D143-94) using a miniature material tester. The drying curve was characterized by a second-order/quadratic equation.  This equation was then differentiated to get the drying rate curve.  Observation on drying and drying rate curves revealed that the rate of moisture loss consists of two falling rate periods; no constant rate drying period was observed.  First falling rate drying period is controlled by convective heat transfer.  Bound water diffusion controls the second falling rate drying period. Species, cutting direction, dimension, and temperature were found to have significant effect on drying rate of wood flakes.  Southern yellow pine has the fastest drying rate followed by sweetgum then yellow-poplar.  Differences in drying rate between species were attributed to differences in specific gravity and other factors.  Radially-cut specimens have a slower drying rate than tangentially-cut specimens.  There were also significant differences in drying rate between the four different flake dimensions. Thickness was found to be the more sensitive parameter in terms of dimensions.  As expected, drying temperature also had highly significant effect on drying rate.   An increasing trend in drying rate was observed as drying temperature increased. Simulation of flake drying using a numerical model yielded a different result.  Simulated flake drying has two drying periods: a constant rate and falling rate.  Moisture of the flake decreases constantly and surface temperature increases rapidly to boiling point and remains there in the constant rate drying period.  During the falling rate period, rate of moisture transport is limited by the ability of water to diffuse through wood and flake temperature starts to rise. Bending properties were found to vary between and within the three species.  Southern yellow pine had the lowest bending stiffness and strength followed by sweetgum while yellow-poplar had the highest bending properties.  Radially-cut specimens were found to have lower MOE, MOR, and SPL than tangentially-cut specimens.  Drying temperature was also found to have a significant effect on bending stiffness and strength.  A decreasing trend in bending properties was observed when drying temperature was increased.",
