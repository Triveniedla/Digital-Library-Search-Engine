  "description_abstract": "The motivation and importance of this study was influenced by my own experience of transitioning from traditional face-to-face to online instruction.  For this study, I conducted telephone interviews with 12 instructors meeting the specified qualifications.  I also conducted email interviews with participants for 5 weeks.  Transcripts of all interviews are located in the appendices.  I used a combination of first person, hermeneutic and existential phenomenological approaches to investigate the lived experiences of college and university instructors who have transitioned from traditional face-to-face to online instruction.  Several minor themes were revealed.  The overall theme is that the online classroom system is an emerging culture with some unique advantages.  The paper ends with a major question to be further examined: Would the results be different if less experienced instructors were interviewed?",
