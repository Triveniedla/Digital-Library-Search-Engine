  "description_abstract": "Some equations of linear elasticity are developed, including those  specific to certain actuator structures considered in formation  theory.  The invariance of the strain-energy under the transformation  from rectangular to spherical coordinates is then established for use  in two specific formation problems.  The first problem, involving an  elastic structure with a cylindrical equilibrium configuration, is  formulated in two dimensions using polar coordinates.  It is shown  that $L^2$ controls suffice to obtain boundary displacements in  $H^{1/2}$.  The second problem has a spherical equilibrium  configuration and utilizes the elastic equations in spherical  coordinates.  Results similar to those obtained in the two dimensional  case are indicated for the three dimensional problem.",
