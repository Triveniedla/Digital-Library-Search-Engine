Wright Abstract</title> </head>  <body> <p>The  purpose of the study was to identify student summer activities and determine  whether a relationship exists between the activities and mathematics testing  change scores measured from spring to fall. This current effort built upon  research conducted by Heyns (1978), Burkam et al. (2004), Downey et al. (2004),  and Alexander et al. (2007). The commonality in findings that existed among all  of these efforts was that learning loss occurred in the absence of instruction  such as that experienced during the normal school term. A quantitative,  correlational study was conducted using a survey method which requested that  parents answer questions concerning the nature of activities and daily structure  experienced by their children during the summer break. </p> <p>The Group Mathematics Assessment and  Diagnostic Evaluation (GMADE) testing platform wasÂ  used to generate quantitative measurements of  mathematics skills for exiting second graders in the spring of 2010 and for  these same students as entering third graders in the fall of 2010. A voluntary  sample of 57 students from elementary schools in a suburban school district in Southwestern Virginia participated in the testing process.  At the conclusion of all testing and at the point at which all surveys were  completed, student scoring differentials from spring to fall were compared to  the activity and daily structure components reported in the survey for  potential correlations between that information and mean gain test results. Â </p> <p>This study sought potential correlations between types of  summer activities and documented change between mathematics spring and fall  test scores. Results of data analysis from this research will assist leaders in  understanding whether activities bear a relationship to mathematics score  changes. Should those relationships be established, the findings would assist  leaders in determining which activities should be encouraged or discouraged  during the summer break to avoid score declines. The findings indicated that  though summer mathematics learning loss did occur for the participants, no  correlation between activities and test score change could be established. Implications  of these findings and suggestions for the future are presented in the final  chapter.</p> </body> </html>",
