  "description_abstract": "THE IMPACT OF STUDENT ATTENDANCE SOCIO-ECONOMIC STATUS AND MOBILITY ON STUDENT ACHIEVEMENT OF THIRD GRADE STUDENTS IN TITLE I SCHOOLS By D. Jean Jones Abstract Today, regular school attendance is an important factor in school success (Rothman, 2001). Research has shown a direct correlation between good attendance and student achievement (Dekalb, 1999). Poor attendance has been linked to poor academic achievement (Ziegler, 1972). With the increase in accountability for school districts in Virginia surrounding the Standards of Learning (SOL) test and the No Child Left Behind (NCLB) legislation of 2001, educators are faced with a significant challenge to reduce the rate of absenteeism to increase studentsâ   achievement in school. â  Students who are absent from school receive fewer hours of instruction; they often leave education early and are more likely to become long term unemployed, homeless, caught in the poverty trap, dependent on welfare and involved in the justice systemâ   (House of Representatives, 1996 p. 3). Researchers have sought to find factors that contribute to student non-attendance (Odell, 1923; Reid, 1999; Mitchell, 1993). This study investigates the impact of student attendance, socio-economic status and mobility on student achievement of third grade students in two Title I schools in a Southeastern Virginia School District, with grades PK-3, as determined by the Virginia Standards of Learning (SOL) English and math tests scores.",
