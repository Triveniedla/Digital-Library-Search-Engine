  "description_abstract": "This dissertation examines aspects of both the consumer (the \"give\") and the server (the \"take\") sides of restaurant tipping.  On the consumer side, I address both why, and how much, people tip in restaurants.  I also examine a policy issue related to the recent Supreme Court decision in United States v. Fior d'Italia.  These issues are addressed via a combination of theoretical, empirical, and experimental analysis.  On the server side, I use survey data collected from several restaurants to address the issue of labor market discrimination based on beauty.  Specifically, do more attractive servers earn higher tips than less attractive servers?  I argue that a tipping data set offers several advantages over data sets used in previous studies of the beauty wage gap.  This dissertation was funded by a National Science Foundation Dissertation Enhancement Grant (NSF #427347).",
