  "description_abstract": "This study focused on the University of Wisconsin Stout's  (UW Stout) implementation of the Malcolm Baldridge Award (MBNQA) Criteria for Educational Performance Excellence.  The study had two objectives: (1) to determine administrator, faculty, and staff/support staff perceptions and compare those perceptions; and, (2) to identify the positive and negative views each of the three groups held regarding the implementation process. The study design was a mixed method approach which used both qualitative and quantitative research methodologies. Administrators, faculty, and staff/support staff at UW Stout were randomly selected to participate in the study. The instrument used to gather information contained 26 quantitative, two qualitative, and three demographic questions. Qualitative data were analyzed using analysis of variance with an alpha level established at .05. Results revealed significant differences in participants' perceptions for four of the seven MBNQA categories. Tukey Post-Hoc tests were performed for each of the significant categories. Post-Hoc tests for all four categories indicated that administrative participants had significantly more positive perceptions of MBNQA education criteria implementation than faculty or staff/support staff.  A content analysis of the qualitative data revealed five positive themes:  (1) Recognition as a Center of Excellence, (2) Pride in Affiliation, (3) Positive Exposure/Marketing Opportunities, (4) Conduit for Continuous Improvement, and (5) Increased Communication.  Analysis also revealed nine common negative themes: (1) Perceived Opportunity Costs, (2) Education/Training Needs. (3) A Lack of Continuous Improvement, (4) Increased Workload, (5) Disconnect Between the Award and the University Mission, (6) Campus Climate, (7) Increased Quality Expectations, (8) Decisions Being Made Without Following the Baldridge Model, and (9) Insufficient Employee Recognition.<p> Study findings may provide insight regarding employees' differing views of quality implementation at the university level. Results of this investigation may be useful to quality consultants who assist others in the establishment of institutional quality initiatives as well as higher education administrators who are considering MBNQA criteria implementation at their own institutions.",
