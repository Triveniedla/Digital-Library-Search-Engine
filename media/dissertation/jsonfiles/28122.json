  "description_abstract": "This study develops and tests a theoretical model  drawing on social psychological and  resource-mobilization perspectives of social movement  theory to explain changes in social movement participation  and support for activism among Earthwatch Expedition  volunteers. The social psychological perspective of  social movements recognizes the role of self-efficacy  and consciousness-raising for the participation in and  success of social movement organizations.  The resource  mobilization perspective of social movements stresses  rationality and the importance of funding and networks  for the success of social movement organizations.   Utilizing these two theoretical perspectives as my  foundation, I hypothesize that participation in an  Earthwatch Expedition increases volunteers' participation  in social movement organizations in ways such as making  monetary donations, voting with the organization's platform  in mind, or attending rallies and marches.  I also hypothesize  that volunteers will increase their support for others who  participate in these same types of activities. Earthwatch  Expeditions are a form of alternative tourism in which  volunteers participate in any of 126 different types of 10-14  day research-oriented expeditions that may include evaluating  the health of a coral reef, studying maternal health among west  African women, assessing the killer whale population off  the coast of Puget Sound, or recording oral history in Dominica.   I conducted pre- and post-trip surveys in June and July of 1998,  resulting in 363 completed surveys. I analyzed data using  multiple regression to discover relationships between pre-trip  and post-trip measures of social movement participation, activism  support, networks, self-efficacy, and consciousness-raising.   In other words, I explored ways in which an alternative tourism  experience like Earthwatch can change a person's ideas about  their own social movement participation, the social movement  activities of others, their perceived ability to overcome  obstacles in order to implement social change, and their awareness  of social issues. Results suggest that participation in an  Earthwatch Expedition has a positive effect on volunteers'  social movement participation, their awareness of social issues,  their networks, and their ability to overcome obstacles, but  little effect on activism support.",
