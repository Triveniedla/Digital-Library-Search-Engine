  "description_abstract": "The copious information generated from transcriptomes gives us an opportunity to learn biological processes as integrated systems; however, due to numerous sources of variation, high dimensions of data structure, various levels of data quality, and different formats of the inputs, dissecting and interpreting such data presents daunting challenges to scientists. The goal of this research is to provide improved and new statistical tools for analyzing transcriptomes data to identify gene expression patterns for classifying samples, to discover regulatory gene networks using natural genetic perturbations, to develop statistical methods for model fitting and comparison of biochemical networks, and eventually to advance our capability to understand the principles of biological processes at the system level.",
