  "description_abstract": "Fiber reinforced polymer (FRP) composites are considered very promising for infrastructure applications such as repair, rehabilitation and replacement of deteriorated bridge decks. However, there is lack of proper understanding of the structural behavior of FRP decks. For example, due to the localization of load under a truck tire, the conventionally used uniform patch loading is not suitable for performance evaluation of FRP composite deck systems with cellular geometry and relatively low modulus (compared to concrete decks). In this current study, a simulated tire patch loading profile has been proposed for testing and analysis of FRP deck. The tire patch produced significantly different failure mode (local transverse failure under the tire patch) compared to the punching-shear mode obtained using the conventional rectangular steel plate. The local response of a cellular FRP composite deck has been analyzed using finite element simulation and results are compared with full scale laboratory experiment of bridge deck and structure. Parametric studies show that design criteria based on global deck displacement is inadequate for cellular FRP deck and local deformation behavior must be considered. The adhesive bonding method is implemented for joining of bridge deck panels and response of structural joint analyzed experimentally. Strength, failure mode and fatigue life prediction methodologies for a cellular FRP bridge deck are presented in this dissertation.",
