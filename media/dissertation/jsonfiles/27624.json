  "description_abstract": "Factors Related to Information Technology Implementation in the Malaysian Ministry of Education Polytechnics  Zulkifli Zakaria   (ABSTRACT)  The purpose of this study was to examine factors related to information technology (IT) implementation in the curriculum. The focus was on Malaysian Ministry of Education Polytechnic (MoEP) faculty members√¢   attitudes toward IT, as well as IT availability and IT use in teaching. The response rate from the 332 surveys sent to the MoEP was 75.9%.  Faculty members as a whole appeared to have readiness for adoption of changes related to IT use in teaching despite the lack of IT use in general. The use of selected IT items was skewed greatly in the direction of non-use. Faculty attitudes toward the use of IT in their teaching were very positive.   The overall professional development experiences in IT that respondents had were greatly skewed toward non-participation. Results for items associated with supports services showed that they were available for faculty use.  Sixty-nine percent of the respondents reported to face barriers to the use IT in their teaching.  The extent of IT use in general for male respondents and female respondents showed a significant difference among gender. ANOVA revealed no difference between MoEP membership and IT use in general. Analysis of department membership and IT use in general revealed no difference between the two. Highest level of education had a low significant correlation with extent of IT use in general. A low negative correlation was shown between highest level of education and other demographic variables. Age had a moderate positive correlation with years served for the MoEP and a high correlation with years served for the MoE. Years served for the MoEP also has a moderate correlation with years served for the MoE. There were no significant correlations among variables except for online discussion and teaching load. Highest level of education showed a low correlation with email, WWW, and scanner.  Multiple regression analysis was conducted to determine what variables were the best predictors of IT use. Results revealed an R2 of 0.04. Highest level of education contributed significantly to the variance. Adoption proneness proved to be a predictor for IT use in teaching, while other selected demographic variables were not significant predictors.",
