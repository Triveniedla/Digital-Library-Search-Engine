  "description_abstract": "This study explores how 30 long-term lesbian couples, who have lived together 15 or more years, conceptualize and practice equality within their partnerships. Verbal pictures of each couple provide a sense of who they are, how they met, and what is important to them. Dialogue about the egalitarian nature of their relationships and how they practice equality permeates this analysis. These couples practice an interdependent power based on a high degree of mutuality and joint responsibility for the relationship. They share many common values, particularly the value of equality. By comparing and contrasting the personally constructed equalities of these couples, the socially constructed meanings of equality become visible. Equality is not something they see themselves striving to achieve; instead, equality is a result of how they practice money and power.",
