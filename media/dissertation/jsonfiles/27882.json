  "description_abstract": "School Psychologists√¢   Job Satisfaction: Ten Years Later (ABSTRACT)  This study was designed to replicate nationwide surveys completed in 1982 and 1992.  The purpose was to examine and describe the levels of job satisfaction and the relationship between the variables in a national sample of school psychologists belonging to the National Association of School Psychologists (NASP).  The sample for this study consisted of respondents who reported being full-time school practitioners.    Data were collected through mailed survey packets including a data form and a modified version of the 1977 Minnesota Satisfaction Questionnaire (MSQ).  Packets were mailed to 500 randomly selected members of the National Association of School Psychologists.  Of the 308 packets returned, 234 were full-time school practitioners and were included in the analysis.  Results indicated that 90% of school psychologists were satisfied or very satisfied with their jobs.  The findings showed a gradual increase in overall job satisfaction when compared to the 85.7% in 1982 and the 86% in 1992 who reported being satisfied or very satisfied with their jobs. Participants in the current sample were more satisfied with their job security, independence, and creativity.  The only variables demonstrating a significant relationship with job satisfaction were the intent to remain in current position and supervisor certification.    Several recommendations and implications were drawn from the study.  Trends in the field relating to gender, psychologist-to-student ratio, salary, degree status, and numerous other factors were discussed along with recommendations for future research.",
