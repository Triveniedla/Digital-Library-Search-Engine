  "description_abstract": "This is a qualitative exploratory, descriptive study to ascertain the feasibility of public administrators at the local government level using an Appreciative Inquiry approach to increase direct citizen participation.  It is framed by the interpretive paradigm.  Twenty city managers or their designees from cities of between 40,000 and 250,000 citizens were interviewed.  Specifically, respondents were asked twelve semi-structured interview questions.  Content analysis was used to identify six themes in the data.  Ultimately, this study found that Appreciative Inquiry may be useful in limited circumstances as long as barriers to implementation were adequately addressed.  However, the potential risks may outweigh the benefits.",
