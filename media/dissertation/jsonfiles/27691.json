  "description_abstract": "The present research expanded upon the work of Breland and Donovan (in press) and examined the role of three-dimensional state goal orientation in an integrative model of goal setting and task performance. In addition, mental focus (Lee, Sheldon, & Turban, 2003) was also incorporated into the model. Results indicated that each of the three-dimensions of state goal orientation uniquely affected oneâ  s level of self-efficacy. More specifically, state learning goal orientation and state performance-approach goal orientation both enhanced an individualâ  s level of self-efficacy, while state performance-avoidance goal orientation reduced their level of self-efficacy. In turn state goal orientation indirectly impacted mental focus, goals, and performance through its influence on self-efficacy. Implications of these findings as well as suggestions for future research on the personality construct of state goal orientation are discussed.",
