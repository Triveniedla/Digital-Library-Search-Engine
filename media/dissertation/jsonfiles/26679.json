  "description_abstract": "The perceptions of bullying and the amount of training related to bullying issues experienced by principals was the topic of this study. Elementary principals in the Commonwealth of Virginia were surveyed on their understanding of bullying, the amount of training they received, and what additional staff development needs they perceived would help them to effectively deal with the problem of bullying in their schools. The study found that principals varied in their understanding of the definition of bullying and needed more information and training in order to effectively deal with this problem. The study makes recommendations for how school districts can increase principalsâ   understanding of bullying and what training needs to be implemented to help principals effectively deal with this problem.",
