  "description_abstract": "Sixty families who came to a county mental health center for a substance abuse evaluation for a teenager were interviewed. The parent(s) and teenager were administered the Emotional Cutoff Scale, a paper-and-pencil measure. The functioning of each parent was assessed by the researcher through the Global Assessment of Functioning. The child was evaluated on the Child and Family Assessment Scale, an eight dimension scale.  Data were gathered and analyzed through a correlational matrix. Significant correlations  at P>.01 were found for degree of cutoff  of the mother from her mother and father and her level of self-functioning but not with the level of impairment of the teenager. The sample of fathers did not result in significant correlations.",
