  "description_abstract": "<p>Halogenated monocyclic and bicyclic heteroaromatic azines, possessing a six or ten w-electron system and one or two ring nitrogens, have been shown to undergo nucleophilic displacement of halide ion with a variety of nucleophiles. A detailed review of the relative reactivity of compounds of these classes, as well as halogenated heteroaromatic azines containing as many as four nitrogen atoms has appeared.</p>",
