  "description_abstract": "The aim of this project was to investigate the impact of language proficiency (represented in first and second language) on working memory capacity. A sample of 100 college students from Virginia Tech University completed an on-line survey, performed 2 computer-based working memory capacity tasks (the OSPAN and the Letter Rotation) and had their first language (L1) as well as their second language (L2) proficiency tested. All participants were classified on a five-point likert scale from â  poorâ   to â  excellentâ  . Verbal WMC (as measured by OSPAN) was associated with L2 proficiency. However, the L2 â  excellentâ   group did not differ in their OSPAN from the remaining four groups of L2 proficiency classification. No correlation was found between the two WMC tasks.",
