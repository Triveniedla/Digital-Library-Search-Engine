  "description_abstract": "This analysis studies the reaction ep ! e0p0Ã  in the kinematical range 1:6 Â· Q2 Â· 3:8 GeV2 and 2:0 Â· W Â· 3:0 GeV at CLAS. After successful signal identification, total and differential cross sections are measured and compared to the world data set. Comparisons are made to the predictions of the Jean-Marc Laget(JML) model based on Pomeron plus 2-gluon exchange. The overall scaling of the total cross section was determined to be 1=Q4:6Â§1:7 which is compatible within errors to the Vector Meson Dominance prediction of 1/Q4 as well as to the expected behavior of a quark and gluon exchange-dominated model described by Generalized Parton Distributions of 1/Q6. The differential cross section dÂ¾dÂ© was used to determine that the s-channel helicity conservation (SCHC) assumption is valid within the precision of the current data. SCHC leads to a simple expression for the decay angular distribution from which R, the ratio of the longitudinal to the transverse cross section, can be extracted. Under the assumption of SCHC, we determine R = 1:33Â§0:18 at an average Q2 of 2:21 GeV2 which leads to a determination of the longitudinal cross section Â¾L = 5:3 Â§ 1:3 nb for exclusive Ã  production.",
