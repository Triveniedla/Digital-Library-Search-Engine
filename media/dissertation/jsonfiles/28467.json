  "description_abstract": "Among sheep producers, the parasitic nematode Haemonchus contortus is a major animal  health concern. Caribbean hair sheep are more resistant than conventional wool breeds to this  blood-feeding, abomasal parasite. Our objective was to determine differences in the immune  response associated with parasite-resistant hair and susceptible wool lambs infected with 10,000  H. contortus and in uninfected controls. Animals were sacrificed and abomasum and lymph node tissues were collected at 3 or 27 days post-infection (PI), and for controls on day 17, 27, or 38 relative to d 0 of infected animals. Blood and fecal samples were collected throughout the  study.  Lower fecal egg counts, higher packed cell volumes, and heavier lymph nodes of infected  hair compared to wool lambs, suggests hair lambs have increased parasite resistance. Greater  tissue infiltration of eosinophils (P < 0.05) was observed in hair compared to wool sheep by 3  days PI, with no breed differences in globule leukocytes. Total serum IgA and IgE were greater  in control hair versus wool sheep (P < 0.05). After 3, 5, and 21 of infection, total serum IgA (P< 0.05), total lymph node IgE (P < 0.01), but not total serum IgE were greater in hair sheep  compared to wool sheep.  Gene expression was measured between hair and wool lambs for abomasal and lymph  node tissues using bovine cDNA microarrays and real-time RT-PCR. Microarray analysis  revealed cell survival, endosome function, gut motility, and anti-coagulation pathways are  important in abomasal and lymph node tissues during H. contortus infection. Immune genes,  including IL-4, IL-4 Ra, IL-12 Rb1, and IL-12 Rb2, are also highly represented in abomasal or  lymph node tissue of infected animals. Eleven genes were evaluated using real-time RT-PCR  and included TH1 and TH2 cytokines, cytokine receptors, and IgE. Parasite infection leads to  increased expression of IL-13 and IgE in both tissues and breeds when compared to control  animals. Breed comparison of gene expression shows resistant hair sheep produce a stronger  modified TH2-type immune response during infection. Differential cell infiltration, antibody production, and regulation of TH2 cytokines between breeds may be partially responsible for differences in parasite resistance.",
