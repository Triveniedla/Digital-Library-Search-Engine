  "description_abstract": "This dissertation describes preparation and characterization of Ni2P catalysts and their application in hydrodesulfurization (HDS) and hydrodenitrogenation (HDN).  The work carried out includes synthesis of Ni2P on different siliceous supports, SiO2 and MCM-41.  It also includes characterization of these catalytic materials using X-ray diffraction (XRD), temperature-programmed reduction (TPR), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and X-ray absorbance fine structure (XAFS) spectroscopy.  In situ FTIR was employed to study the acidity of Ni2P/SiO2 and probe the catalytic sites involved in the HDN of pyridine. Transient and steady-state kinetics of a surface intermediate that is formed upon pyridine adsorption and reaction was studied to elucidate the mechanism of HDN over Ni2P/SiO2.  Additionally, in situ FTIR and X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) spectroscopy was utilized to probe the bonding, mechanism and kinetics of thiophene HDS over a novel MCM-41-supported Ni2P catalyst.  The use of these techniques allowed for better understanding of the surface intermediates, mechanisms and the nature of the active sites involved in HDN and HDS.",
