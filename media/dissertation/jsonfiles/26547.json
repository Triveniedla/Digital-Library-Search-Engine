  "description_abstract": "<html> <head> <title>Wolfe Abstract</title> <meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=iso-8859-1\"> </head>  <body> <p>The purpose of this study was to use quantitative data to answer the overarching question, what behaviors develop mutual trust, and what is its association to job satisfaction? This study expanded on the research of Tschannen-Moran, considering mutual trust and job satisfaction. Using quantitative research, the researcher considered the five constructs of trust originally identified by Hoy and Tschannen-Moran to determine what behaviors are needed on the part of the principals and teachers to develop mutual trust and if there is an association between mutual trust and job satisfaction. </p> <p>The quantitative data were collected from four schools in a medium-sized rural school division in Virginia. Survey questions were developed with the five constructs of trust from Tschannen-Moran's research as the foundation and provided information on principals' and teachers' behaviors. Most questions were formatted to use a 5-point Likert scale; however, two open-ended questions provided more specific information on behaviors needed to develop mutual trust. Through analysis of the data, the researcher found that the development of trust is primarily the result of the behaviors of the principals. Further, there are differences between the perceptions of principals and teachers regarding behaviors needed to develop trust. </p> <p>This information is helpful for future educators, both principals and teachers. As part of an individual's preparation for a career in education, it is beneficial for them to have some understanding of how to develop a trusting relationship in a school between a teacher and principal. Current administrators need to understand if there is an overall culture of trust in the school they lead, and if not, where the gap in trust is. </p> </body> </html>",
