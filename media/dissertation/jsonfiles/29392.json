  "description_abstract": "The presented research investigated the viability of a double-braided synthetic fiber rope for providing improved performance of steel moment frames subjected to earthquake-induced ground motions.  A series of experimental tests, including a 1:3-scale dynamic test and 1:6-scale shaking table tests, was conducted using Northridge ground-motion input.  A series of nonlinear dynamic analytical studies, using DRAIN-2DX, was conducted to develop the experimental tests.    Throughout experimental testing, the ropes exhibited a hyper-elastic loading response and a reduced-stiffness unloading response.  A conditioning cycle was defined as a loading cycle induced in the rope above the highest load expected to be experienced by the rope, and was determined to be requisite for ropes intended to be used for the stated objectives of the research program.  After experiencing a conditioning cycle, the rope response returned to initial conditions without permanent deformation, demonstrating repeatability of response through several loading cycles below the conditioning load.    In the 1:6-scale shaking-table experiments, the ropes drastically improved the performance of the steel moment frames.  Maximum and residual drift were reduced significantly, with a corresponding minimal increase to the maximum base shear.  Base shear was reduced at several peaks subsequent to the initial pulse of the Northridge ground-motion input.  The analytical model developed was excellent for predicting elastic response of the 1:6-scale shaking table experiments and adequate for the purpose of planning shaking table studies.  Correlation of peak rope forces between the analytical model and experimental results was poor, and was attributed to limitations of the pre-defined elements used to represent the rope devices in the software program.  The inability of the elements to capture the complex unloading response of the rope was specifically noted.",
