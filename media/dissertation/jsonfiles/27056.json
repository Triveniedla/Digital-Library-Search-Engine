  "description_abstract": "The study investigated the effects of self-monitoring on students' academic achievement and self-regulation in an interactive television (ITV) classroom. High school students taking the Japanese courses via ITV were asked to engage in self-monitoring activities, including goal setting, self-recording, and self-evaluation for 6 weeks using online databases. The study employed a quasi-experimental design with pre- and post-tests. and two groups: control and experimental groups, were formed to examine the effects of self-monitoring. Students' test grades and the Motivated Strategies for Learning Questionnaires were used to measure academic achievement and self-regulation. Hierarchical regressions were conducted to analyze the data.  While no significant difference was found between two groups, the study provided directions for future research.",
