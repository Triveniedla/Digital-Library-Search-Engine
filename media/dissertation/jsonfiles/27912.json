  "description_abstract": "New fundamental observables are becoming  accessible with the Leading Proton Spectrometers  (LPS) of ZEUS and H1. This enables us to test  more thoroughly the pQCD mechanism of diffractive  Deep Inelastic Scattering (DIS). Calculations of  the diffractive cross-section in the small  Bjorken x limit have been performed. We have  used the microscopic QCD formalism of  diffractive DIS to find higher twist corrections  to the transverse structure functions and predict  the diffractive slope and azimuthal asymmetries.  We establish duality correspondence between  diffraction into low-mass continuum and vector  meson production, and calculate the diffractive  contribution to the spin structure functions.",
