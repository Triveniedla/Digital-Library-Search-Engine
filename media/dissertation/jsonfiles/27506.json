  "description_abstract": "This research examines the effects of evaluations, beliefs, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control on the contractor's decision intention to recover used CCA lumber.  The purpose of this research was to determine the factors that affect recovery.  This research proposes that a contractor√¢  s decision intention to recover is affected by evaluations, beliefs, subjective norms, and perceived barriers to recovery.   \tThe study included a mail questionnaire that was sent to over 2,800 contractors.  The questionnaire was used to collect both demographic data and an evaluation of the factors believed to affect the recovery of CCA treated lumber.  Data was collected primarily through the mail survey, where participants rated the factors believed to affect the recovery of spent CCA lumber. Extrapolation indicates that nearly 2.4 million cubic meters of treated lumber were removed in 1999 from the demolition of decks.  It was also discerned that only two of the respondents recovered used CCA lumber on a full-time basis.  Additionally, there appears to be a lack of knowledge regarding the chemical components of CCA treated lumber, the proper disposal methods, and handling of the product.  This has profound strategic implications for not only the wood treating industry but other industries as well. The second phase of the research utilized ordinary least squares regression and a structural equation modeling program to model the factors concerning the contractors' decision intention to recover.  The findings indicate that contractor beliefs and components of perceived behavioral control are the primary drivers in the contractor's decision intention to recover.  Regarding beliefs, the findings indicate that contractors have a minimal belief that the recovery of the CCA lumber is necessary.  This indicates that a marketing communications program should be developed to address the necessity and benefits of recovery.   Recovery facilities and programs were found to be nonexistent and will have to be developed in order to facilitate recovery.  Concerning programs, the overwhelming response was that some type of financial incentive would have to be incorporated to initiate recovery.  In conjunction with the development of programs, recovery facilities will have to be developed that are convenient for the contractor to dispose of the used lumber.",
