  "description_abstract": "We study a parameter identification problem for the steady state  diffusion equations. In this thesis, we transform this  identification problem into a minimization problem by considering an  appropriate cost functional and propose a finite element method for the  identification of the parameter for the linear and nonlinear partial  differential equation.  The cost functional involves the classical  output least square term, a term approximating the  derivative of the piezometric head <I>u(x)</I>, an equation error term  plus some regularization terms,   which happen to be a norm or a semi-norm of the variables in the cost functional in an  appropriate Sobolev space. The existence and uniqueness of the  minimizer for the cost functional is proved.  Error estimates in a weighted  <I>H</I><sup>-1</sup>-norm, <I>L</I><sup>2</sup>-norm and <I>L</I><sup>1</sup>-norm for the numerical solution are derived.  Numerical examples  will be given to show features of this numerical method.",
