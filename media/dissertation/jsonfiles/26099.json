  "description_abstract": "An analysis is presented of the linear and geometrically nonlinear static response  of \"thin\" doubly-curved shells of revolution, under internal pressure loading.  The analysis  is based upon direct numerical integration of the governing differential equations, written  in first-order state vector form.   It is assumed that the loading and response of the shell   are  both axially symmetric; the governing equations are thus ordinary differential equations.   The geometry of the shell is limited in the analysis by the assumptions of axisymmetry  and constant thickness.  The shell is allowed to have general composite laminate construc- tion, elastic supports at the edges and internal ring stiffeners.  In addition, the analysis  allows for the possibility of circumferential line loads at discrete locations along the   dome  meridian.  The problem is a numerically unstable two-point boundary value problem; inte- grations are performed using the technique of multiple shooting.  A development of the  multiple shooting technique known as stabilized marching is given.  Results achieved by  use of the multiple shooting technique are verified by comparison to results of finite ele- ment analysis using the finite element analysis codes STAGS and ABAQUS.  Parametric  studies are performed for ellipsoidal domes constructed of symmetric, 8-ply laminates.   The parametric studies examine the effects of dome geometry for a quasi-isotropic lami- nate first, then examine whether material properties may be adjusted to create a \"better\"  design.  Conclusions and recommendations for future work follow.",
