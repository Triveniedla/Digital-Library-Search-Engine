  "description_abstract": "Many organizations aspire to adopt agile processes to take advantage of the numerous benefits that it offers to an organization. Those benefits include, but are not limited to, quicker return on investment, better software quality, and higher customer satisfaction. To date however, there is no structured process (at least that is published in the public domain) that guides organizations in adopting agile practices. To address this situation, we present the Agile Adoption Framework and the innovative approach we have used to implement it. The framework consists of two components: an agile measurement index, and a 4-Stage process, that together guide and assist the agile adoption efforts of organizations. More specifically, the Sidky Agile Measurement Index (SAMI) encompasses five agile levels that are used to identify the agile potential of projects and organizations. The 4-Stage process, on the other hand, helps determine (a) whether or not organizations are ready for agile adoption, and  (b) guided by their potential, what set of agile practices can and should be introduced. To help substantiate the â  goodnessâ   of the Agile Adoption Framework, we presented it to various members of the agile community, and elicited responses through questionnaires.  The results of that substantiation effort are encouraging, and also suggest further avenues for improvement.",
