  "description_abstract": "The purpose of this study was to identify the perception and relationships between corporate entrepreneurship (CE) practices and management performance.  The use of Morris and Kuratko√¢  s (2002) Corporate Entrepreneurship Assessment Instrument (CEAI) was used as the survey instrument for this study.  A sample size of 1,200 unit managers, middle managers, and top management teams (TMTs) within nine casual dining restaurant organizations were surveyed with a response of 522 subjects at a rate of 44%.  Responses of the CEAI results were studied using regression analysis and conclusions were drawn to support four out of the six hypothesis originally proposed in determining CE activity and management reinforcement.  A post test analysis was also conducted in order to reinforce the previous results of the original study.  This study concluded with the determination through an empirical analysis that forms of CE activity and enforcement are currently present within the casual dining restaurant segment.",
