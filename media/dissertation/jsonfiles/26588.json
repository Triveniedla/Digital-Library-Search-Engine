  "description_abstract": "One form of model robust regression (MRR) predicts mean response as a convex  combination of a parametric and a nonparametric prediction. MRR is a semiparametric  method by which an incompletely or an incorrectly specified parametric model can be  improved through adding an appropriate amount of a nonparametric fit. The combined  predictor can have less bias than the parametric model estimate alone and less  variance than the nonparametric estimate alone. Additionally, as shown in previous  work for uncorrelated data with linear mean function, MRR can converge faster than the  nonparametric predictor alone. We extend the MRR technique to the problem of  predicting mean response for clustered non-normal data. We combine a nonparametric  method based on local estimation with a global, parametric generalized estimating  equations (GEE) estimate through a mixing parameter on both the mean scale and the  linear predictor scale. As a special case, when data are uncorrelated, this amounts to  mixing a local likelihood estimate with predictions from a global generalized linear  model. Cross-validation bandwidth and optimal mixing parameter selectors are  developed. The global fits and the optimal and data-driven local and mixed fits are  studied under no/some/substantial model misspecification via simulation. The methods  are then illustrated through application to data from a longitudinal study.",
