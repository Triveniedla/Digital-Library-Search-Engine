  "description_abstract": "\"Women's Experiences of Rage towards their Intimate Partners: Diverse Voices within the Criminal Justice System\" By: Kimberly R. Flemke  Abstract A multi-method study investigating incarcerated womenâ  s experiences of rage towards their intimate partners was conducted. The sample was drawn from a Philadelphia prisonâ  s recovery unit for women. Phenomenological and feminist critical theory perspectives guided the study; these combined approaches captured the essence of rage, while also offering a critical analysis for understanding complexities involved in the cultivation of rage. Three primary forms of data collection methods were used: (a) the Aggression Questionnaire, which was completed by 60 inmates; (b) a Demographic Worksheet, which was completed by 46 inmates and used to screen for subsequent interviews; and (c) in-depth interviews, which was completed by 37 women. Focus groups were used to debrief participants at the completion of the study. Results indicated rage as a distinct experience from anger. Past sources of emotional pain, embedded within shame and trauma, were revealed as fueling current actions of rage. Links between womenâ  s social location, their experiences of rage, and their involvement within the criminal justice system were revealed.",
