  "description_abstract": "Comprehensive year-round limnological investigations of Mountain Lake, Virginia were conducted from November 1992 through October 1994. Monthly physical, chemical, and biological measurements suggest that this ecosystem has shifted toward a more eutrophic condition. A trend in whole lake mean annual orthophosphate-phosphorus and inorganic nitrogen increases have occurred over the past decade, although primary productivity, cell densities, and chlorophyll a values indicate no consistent trends. Hypolimnetic oxygen deficits, however, have continued to increase over time, and in October 1994 the first measure of anoxic deep water was observed.",
