  "description_abstract": "The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) is a hybrid organization managing the most critical Internet infrastructure - the Domain Name System. ICANN represents a new, emerging Internet self-governance model in which the private sector takes the lead and the government sector plays a more marginal role. Little is known, however, about what is actually happening in this new organization.  The dissertation (a) systematically assesses ICANNâ  s overall performance based on a set of evaluative criteria drawn from its mission statements; (b) explores possible factors and actors that influence ICANNâ  s overall performance by tracing the governance processes in three cases based on a preliminary conceptual framework; and (c) suggests practical and theoretical implications of ICANNâ  s governance and performance in its broader institutional context.  The study finds that although differing governance processes have led to different performance outcomes (Lynn et al. 2000), â  stabilityâ   has been the defining value that has shaped the overall path of ICANNâ  s governance and performance. The study characterizes ICANN as a conservative hybrid captured, based on specific issues, by the technical and governmental communities. It also proposes the concept of â  technical captureâ   to suggest how technical experts can have significant, but often implicit, influence over the policy development process in organizations.",
