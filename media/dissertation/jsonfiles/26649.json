  "description_abstract": "The vast majority of commercial gas separation membrane systems are polymeric because of processing feasibility and cost. However, polymeric membranes designed for gas separations have been known to have a trade-off between permeability and selectivity as shown in Robeson's upper bound curves. The search for membrane materials that transcend Robeson's upper bound has been the critical issue in research focused on membranes for gas separation in the past decade. To that end, many researchers have explored the idea of mixed matrix membranes (MMMs). These membranes combine a polymer matrix with inorganic molecular sieves such as zeolites. The ideal filler material in MMMs should have excellent properties as a gas adsorbent or a molecular sieve, good dispersion properties in the polymer matrix of submicron thickness, and should form high quality interfaces with the polymer matrix. <p> In order to increase gas permeance and selectivity of polymeric membranes by fabricating MMMs, we have fabricated mixed matrix membranes using carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and nano-sized mesoporous silica. Mixed matrix membranes containing randomly oriented CNTs showed that addition of nanotubes to a polymer matrix could improve its selectivity properties as well as permeability by increasing diffusivity. Overall increases in permeance and diffusivity for all tested gases suggested that carbon nanotubes can provide high diffusivity tunnels in the CNT within the polymer matrix. This result agreed well with molecular simulation estimations. In order to prepare ordered CNTs membranes, we have developed a simple, fast, commercially attractive, and scalable orientation method. The oriented CNT membrane sample showed higher permeability by one order of magnitude than the value predicted by a Knudsen model. This CNT membrane showed higher selectivities for CO2 over other gas molecules because of preferential interaction of CO2 with the amine functionalized nanotubes, demonstrating practical applications in gas separations.  <p> Recently, mesoporous molecular sieves have been used in MMMs to enhance permeability or selectivity. However, due to their micrometer scale in particle size, the composite membrane was extremely brittle and tended to crack at higher silica loading. In this study, we have developed fabrication techniques to prepare MMMs containing mesoporous MCM-41 nanoparticles on the order of ~50 nm in size. This smaller nanoparticle lead to higher polymer/particle interfacial area and provides opportunity to synthesize higher loading of molecular sieves in polymer matrix up to ~80 vol%. At 80 vol% of nano-sized MCM-41 silica loading, the permeability of the membrane increased dramatically by 300 %. Despite these increases in permeability, the separation factor of the MMMs changed only slightly. Therefore, these nanoscale molecular sieves are more suitable for commercialization of MMMs with very thin selective layers than are micro-sized zeolites or molecular sieves.",
