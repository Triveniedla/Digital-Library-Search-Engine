  "description_abstract": "This project attempted to understand better the relationship between social support and women창  s commitment to an abusive relationship for the purpose of informing social support interventions.  This study was not an intervention; instead, it sought to examine the processes linking receipt of helpful forms of social support from naturally occurring sources with women창  s commitment and stay/leave decisions.  Specifically, it was hypothesized that relationship satisfaction and quality alternatives would mediate the relationship between received social support types (e.g., nondirective support, positive social exchange, tangible assistance, and directive guidance) and battered women창  s feelings of commitment.  Fifty-one battered women living in domestic violence shelters participated in the present study.  Women completed the Revised Conflict Tactics Scale (CTS-2), Inventory of Socially Supportive Behaviors (ISSB), and Investment Model Scale (IMS) along with other measures designed for this study.  Results showed that battered women who received more resources and services (i.e., tangible assistance) endorsed lesser commitment to their abusive relationships; however, other dimensions of social support such as showing concern, giving advice, and spending time in recreational activities were unrelated to commitment.  Further, neither relationship satisfaction nor quality alternatives mediated the relationship between support and commitment; however, relationship satisfaction and quality alternatives demonstrated expected relationships with women창  s commitment.  Potential design limitations as well as clinical and research implications are discussed.",
