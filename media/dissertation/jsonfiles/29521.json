  "description_abstract": "The response of wide flange steel columns subjected to constant axial loads and lateral blast loads was examined.  The finite element program ABAQUS was used to model W8x40 sections with different slendernesses and boundary conditions.  For the response calculations, a constant axial force was first applied to the column and the equilibrium state was determined.  Next, a short duration, lateral blast load was applied and the response time history was calculated.  Changes in displacement time histories and plastic hinge formations resulting from varying the axial load were examined.  The cases studied include single-span and two-span columns.  In addition to ideal boundary conditions, columns with linear elastic, rotational supports were also studied.  Non-uniform blast loads were considered.  Major axis, minor axis, and biaxial bending were investigated.  The effects of strain rate and residual stresses were examined.  The results for each column configuration are presented as a set of curves showing the critical blast impulse versus axial load.  The critical blast impulse is defined as the impulse that either causes the column to collapse or to exceed the limiting deflection criterion.  A major goal of this effort was to develop simplified design and analysis methods.  To accomplish this, two single-degree-of-freedom approaches that include the effects of the axial load were derived.  The first uses a bilinear resistance function that is similar to the one used for beam analysis.  This approach provides a rough estimate of the critical impulse and is suitable only for preliminary design or quick vulnerability calculations.  The second approach uses a nonlinear resistance function that accounts for the gradual yielding that occurs during the dynamic response.  This approach can be easily implemented in a simple computer program or spreadsheet and provides close agreement with the results from the finite element method.",
