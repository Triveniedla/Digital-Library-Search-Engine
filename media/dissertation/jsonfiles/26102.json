  "description_abstract": "<p>This research was undertaken to determine the effect that computer aided design (CAD) had on the spatial visualization abilities of selected gifted adolescents. The following hypotheses was tested: Subjects receiving instruction in CAD will show improvement in spatial visualization ability, as measured by the Revised Minnesota Paper Form Board (RMPFB) test. when  compared to the subjects not receiving CAD instruction.</p>  <p>  The experimental group consisted of 20 students enrolled in the CAD course offered in the 1991 Virginia Governor's School of Technology. The control group consisted of 20 Governor's School students not enrolled in the CAD course. Both groups were pretested using the RMPFB test Form AA to measure entry level spatial visualization. A treatment consisting of three weeks  of CAD instruction using CADKEY 3.5 was given to the experimental group. Following the treatment both groups were post tested using the RMPFB test Form BB to determine their existing level of spatial visualization ability.</p>  <p>  The nonequivalent control group design was used in this study since the experimental group was an intact group and therefore not randomly assigned. ANCOVA statistical analysis was used to determine if there was statistical significance of the post test scores.</p>",
