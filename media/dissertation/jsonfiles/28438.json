  "description_abstract": "<p>The examination of literature and art has been one of psychotherapy's most powerful ways of explicating its theories and disseminating its concepts. In this study, I have explored various concepts of family psychotherapy by applying them to three works of imaginative literature, and one work of sculpture: Luigi Pirandello's play, Six Characters in Search of an Author, Franz Kafka's novella, The Metamorphosis, Robinson Jeffers' poem, \"The Purse-Seine,\" and the ancient Roman sculpture, the Laocoon.",
