  "description_abstract": "The present study involved the implementation of one component, Community Health Status Assessment, of a comprehensive, strategic planning tool, Mobilizing for Action through Planning and Partnerships (MAPP), to qualitatively uncover the perceptions of the quality of life and local health care system of 28 residents in New River Valley (NRV), Virginia. The current study represents the initial qualitative study utilizing MAPP in Virginia. Interviewees perceived an overall good quality of life (e.g., ample green space, safe neighborhoods), with an urgent need for health care reform, affordable insurance, and transportation, particularly for after-hours medical care. The current study also reviews the specific findings from the one-on-one interviews, and provides a step-by-step look at the MAPP process for potential users as applied to a real-world community, specifically, the NRV.",
