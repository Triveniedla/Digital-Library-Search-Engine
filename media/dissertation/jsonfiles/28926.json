  "description_abstract": "We use Monte Carlo simulations in order to investigate the density of states and the two-time density autocorrelation function for the two- and three-dimensional Coulomb glass as well as the Bose glass phase of flux lines in type-II superconductors. We find a very fast forming gap in the density of states and explore the dependence of temperature and filling fraction. By studying two scaling methods, we find that the nonequilibrium relaxation properties can be described sufficiently by a full-aging scaling analysis. The scaling exponents depend on both temperature and filling fraction, and are thus non-universal. We look at the trends of these exponents and found that as either the temperature decreases or the filling fraction deviates more from half-filling, the exponents reflect slower relaxation kinetics. With two separate interaction potentials, a comparison of relaxation rates and the gap in the density of states is made.",
