  "description_abstract": "This work discusses <i>autonomous computing systems</i>, as implemented  in hardware, and the properties required for such systems to function.  Particular attention is placed on shifting the associated complexity  into the systems themselves, and making them responsible for their own  resources and operation.  The resulting systems present simpler  interfaces to their environments, and are able to respond to changes  within themselves or their environments with little or no outside  intervention.  This work proposes a roadmap for the development of  autonomous computing systems, and shows that their individual components  can be implemented with present day technology. <p> This work further implements a proof-of-concept demonstration system  that advances the state-of-the-art.  The system detects activity on  connected inputs, and responds to the conditions without external  assistance.  It works from mapped netlists, that it dynamically parses,  places, routes, configures, connects, and implements within itself, at  the finest granularity available, while continuing to run.  The system  also models itself and its resource usage, and keeps that model  synchronized with the changes that it undergoes&mdash;a critical  requirement for autonomous systems.  Furthermore, because the system  assumes responsibility for its resources, it is able to dynamically  avoid resources that have been masked out, in a manner suitable for  defect tolerance.",
