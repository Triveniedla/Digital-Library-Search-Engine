  "description_abstract": "<html> <head> <title>Ulrich Abstract</title> <meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=iso-8859-1\"> </head>  <body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\"> <p> Using grounded theory methodology, the purpose of the study was to examine    the transition experiences of older workers who retired from their long-term    careers and who were working in bridge jobs. After interviewing 24 participants,    a theory emerged that describes the decision to seek a bridge job, the strategies    used, the problems faced, and the benefits received. The decision to retire    is connected with the decision to seek a bridge job. Participants planned but    mainly focused on their finances; no participant sought help from a career counseling    professional. They faced challenges such as age discrimination and problems    switching to a new position. Participants reported that they live a more balanced    life and enjoy their bridge job. The core theme from the study is bridge employment    redefines retirement. </p> </body> </html>",
