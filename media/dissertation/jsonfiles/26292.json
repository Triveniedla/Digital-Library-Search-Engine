  "description_abstract": "The purpose of this study was two-fold. First a confirmatory factor analysis was performed to test the validity of a theoretical model of corporate values. The model hypothesized was supported by relevant research cited in the literature on corporate cultures, organizational change and values development. Second, based on the outcome of the factor analysis a measurement scale was devised and refined in an effort to bring to the ERD community a valid and reliable instrument for measuring corporate values. T<p>he following methodological steps were taken for empirical test and instrument development: a) an item pool was systematically selected; b) a panel of experts was selectedi c) a field test was performed on a small samplei d) the instrument was modified and administered to a broader more representative population of employees; e) a mUltiple-group confirmatory factor analysis was performed; f) logical and content analyses were performed; g) the instument was critiq~ed by a capstone panel of HRD professionals as to readiness for introduction into the field.",
