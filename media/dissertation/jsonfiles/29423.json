  "description_abstract": "Semiclassical and Born-Oppenheimer approximations are used to provide uniform error bounds for the energies of diatomic molecules for bounded vibrational quantum number n and large angular momentum quantum number l. Specifically, results are given when (l + 1) < κ𝛜⁻³/². Explicit formulas for the approximate energies are also given. Numerical comparisons for the H+₂ and HD+ molecules are presented.",
