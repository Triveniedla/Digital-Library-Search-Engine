  "description_abstract": "THE TECHNOLOGICAL INFRASTRUCTURE OF SCIENCE  by  Michael William Seltzer  Dr. Joseph C. Pitt, Ph.D., Chair  Science and Technology Studies   ABSTRACT    \tIn this dissertation, I explore a selection of recent work in the philosophy and history of experiment, with an eye toward reformulating its focus and redirecting its future path.  Specifically, I re-examine a traditional problem in the philosophy of experiment:  how to make sense of scientistsâ   attempts to separate experimental â  signalâ   or â  entityâ   from background â  noiseâ   or â  artifact.â    This aspect of the analysis of the practice of scientistsâ  the day to day task of getting oneâ  s experimental equipment and techniques to give reliable results that will be accepted by prevailing scientific standardsâ  requires modifications in order to be made compatible with an adequate notion of historiography and with a philosophically and historically tenable view of scientific epistemology.  I show that the concept of historical narrative is a crucial, if not primary, construct in answering these questions about interpreting experimental practice.  Particular historical narratives, and the historiographies that guide their construction, constitute the crucial evidence for any legitimate view of the epistemological and cultural significance of scientific experimentation.  However, narrativity and historiography must be deconstructed before their conceptual significance for experimentation can be evaluated adequately.  The metahistorical construct I implement in order to analyze questions concerning scientific experimentation is the technological infrastructure of science. \tJoseph Pittâ  s concept of the technological infrastructure of science, a material/cultural network of artifacts and structures that enables and sustains the mature sciences, provides the theoretical foundation for my analysis of experimentation.  I extend and refine Pittâ  s concept of technological infrastructure in order to create a metahistorical tool that researchers in many fields, including Science and Technology Studies (STS), Philosophy of Science, Philosophy of Technology, Cultural Studies (of Science and Technology), History of Science, and History of Technology, may utilize when analyzing experimentation.  To this end, I develop the technological infrastructure as an incorporation, extension and/or replacement of, for example, Thomas Kuhnâ  s â  disciplinary matrix,â   Bruno Latourâ  s â  network,â   Peter Galisonâ  s â  short-, middle-, and long-term constraints,â   Ian Hackingâ  s â  coherence of thought, action, materials, marks,â   Hans-JÃ¶rg Rheinbergerâ  s â  experimental system,â   Andrew Pickeringâ  s â  mangle of practice,â   and Richard M. Burianâ  s â  interaction of mechanisms, of structures and functions, at a great many levels.â",
