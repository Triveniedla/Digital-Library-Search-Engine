  "description_abstract": "The purpose of this study was to assess the validity, as well as to test novel approaches to improving the reliability, of mechanical response tissue analysis (MRTA).  Twenty composite tibiae underwent MRTA testing on three separate days to determine intra- and inter-day reliability of bending stiffness.  The bones were then subjected to three-point bending tests to directly determine elastic modulus.  Within- and between-day reliability of tibial bending stiffness with MRTA was moderate (CV = 24%) and poor (CV = 74%), respectively.  No relationship was observed between the two testing methods due to the wide variation in tibial bending stiffness values with MRTA.  The second part of the study sought to determine within- and between-day reliability of MRTA in young women with the current testing protocol and compare the results with those from newly-designed protocols.  Twelve women (23 Â± 2 yr, 162 Â± 7 cm, 57 Â± 7kg, 19 Â± 4 % fat) were tested for tibial bending stiffness with MRTA over 5 days.  The current protocol was compared to protocols where day-to-day subject positioning was quantified, subjects were tested in a supine position, and various bending stiffness prediction models were used.  Within- (CV = 20%) and between-day (CV = 19%) reliability of tibial bending stiffness with MRTA was moderate using the original methodology.  Modifications to this protocol either resulted in similar or worse reliability.",
