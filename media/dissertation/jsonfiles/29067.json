  "description_abstract": "A new active-passive approach for the control of noise radiated from a small axial fan was investigated. The approach involved the installation of an axial fan into a short duct with both passive and active noise control functions. First, a systematic methodology for the analytical modeling of finite-length ducts with multiple discontinuities was formulated. The procedure involved the modeling of a duct as a collection of simple duct sections, which were interconnected at multiple junctions. Analytical studies have shown that a short lined duct provides passive noise reduction effects through the mass-loading effect of the duct air volume at low frequencies and the sound absorption by a passive liner at high frequencies. It was also shown that active control can provide further noise attenuations at low-to-mid frequencies, thereby enhancing the overall noise control performance. Two alternate designs of active-passive noise control fan duct were considered. One was a simple non- segmented duct with a 2x2 active control and the other was an internally segmented duct with an 8x8 active control. It was indicated that the latter design possesses a significantly higher global noise control potential than the former with respect to both bandwidth and attenuation level. This was attributed to the reduction of the unwanted pressure contributions from the duct cross modes through the high frequency shifting of the associated cut-on frequencies. The experimental validation of the noise control approach was also carried out. An active-passive noise control fan duct incorporating the segmented duct design with 8x8 active control was constructed in conjunction with a hybrid feedforward-feedback control system. Experimental results have shown significant reductions in the total fan noise power associated with the first four BPF tones by the feedforward control and the broadband fan noise power by the feedback control. The overall active-passive noise control characteristics were observed to be in accordance with the analytical results.",
