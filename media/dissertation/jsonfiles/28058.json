In order to explore and describe those experiences provided by the  middle school principals a phenomenological research design was used for this  study. Those participants who were interviewed work in middle schools within  Region V of the Virginia School University Partnership. This research project  included two steps in data collection. The first step required the assistant  principals to examine the Interstate School Leaders Licensure Consortium  Standards (ISLLC), and indicate whether they had experienced those functions  under each standard in one or more of three areas: principal preparation, job  responsibility, and district professional development. The second parts of the  study involved follow up interview questions for each in the participants. The findings  of the study discuss that the standards are addressed and also how the  assistant principals feel about their preparation and school district  professional development.</p> </body> </html>",
