  "description_abstract": "The number of English language learners continues to grow in United Statesâ   schools and their achievement level continues to lag behind their peers. This developmental study investigated the design and development of a multimedia environment that embedded cognitive strategy instruction to assist ELL studentsâ   academic content learning. High school ELL students face the hardship of preparing for various state mandated graduation requirements while learning the English language and learning strategies are believed to help ELL students improve their learning. The multimedia tutorial embedded rehearsal, elaboration, and compensation learning strategies to help the ELL students understand and recall information about state mandated computer competencies. Formative evaluation was used to gather data from five intermediate Hispanic ELL high school students in grades 9 through 11. Lessons learned from embedding rehearsal, elaboration, and compensation learning strategies in multimedia instruction and recommendations for future development are discussed.",
