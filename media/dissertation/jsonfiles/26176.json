  "description_abstract": "There are 5.7 million people in India who are living with HIV/AIDS and many more are indirectly affected by the epidemic (families, children). Since HIV/AIDS is a growing problem, further research for prevention and treatment is needed. Family therapists possess an important role in the AIDS crisis given that some family therapy models have been shown to work well with HIV issues. Although there is a need for family therapy in India, the profession of family therapy is in its infancy. This study attempts to understand what marriage and family therapy interventions work best with Indian clients especially those who are HIV positive. Psychoeducation, directive therapy, addressing the presenting problem and systems therapy (particularly focusing on the couple husband-wife system) are interventions found in this study to be most utilized by Indian therapists with their clients.",
