  "description_abstract": "In this study, 236 heavy-drinking college students completed measures of self-efficacy for limiting drinking, specific coping skills for limiting drinking, outcome expectancies associated both with expected effects of drinking and expected effects of limiting drinking, and retrospective drinking behavior.  Confirmatory factor analyses were conducted to examine reliability and validity, as well as serving as a pre-requisite for structural equation modeling (SEM).  Results were generally consistent with predictions and supported the distinction between self-efficacy and outcome expectancies.  One notable exception was that positive expectancies for limiting drinking did not load heavily on the predicted expectancy construct.   Three models predicting drinking were compared utilizing SEM.  The first was a model in which all constructs predicted drinking with no indirect effects.  The second was based upon the ideas of Kirsch (1995) and predicted that outcome expectancies influence self-efficacy judgments.  The third was based upon Bandura√¢  s (1986) theory and predicted that self-efficacy judgments would instead influence outcome expectancies.  Both the models based on Kirsch and Bandura appeared to better fit the data than the model with no indirect effects.  Differences in model-fit between models based on Kirsch and Bandura were not large, but slightly supported the Kirsch model.  Additional analyses also supported the importance of outcome expectancies in predicting drinking behavior.  Implications for theory and future directions for research are discussed.",
