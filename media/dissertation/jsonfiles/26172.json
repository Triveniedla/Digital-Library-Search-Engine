  "description_abstract": "We studied the reaction <i>ep -> e'p'phi</i> with a  4.2 GeV incident electron beam in the region of  the electroproduction variables Q<sup>2</sup> from 0.7 to  2.2 GeV<sup>2</sup> and W from 2.0 to 2.6 GeV. The data  were taken and analyzed at the Thomas Jefferson  National Accelerator Facility. For the first time, we observe the expected t-slope dependence on  Q<sup>2</sup> and Delta-Tau in phi vector meson production. We find that the width of the forward phi-meson  diffraction peak increases rapidly as the  interaction time decreases below  cDelta-Tau of  1 fm. Within a simple optical model framework,  the data show that phi meson has a smaller size  than the rho. The measured phi cross-section  dependence on Q<sup>2</sup> is in a good agreement with  previous measurements and well-described by the  phenomenological Pomeron exchange model. Our  cross-section data do not favor the standard  Vector Meson Dominance and ss-bar-knockout model  predictions. From the angular distribution of  the decay phi -> K<sup>+</sup>K<sup>-</sup>, assuming the s-channel  helicity conservation, we extracted the  longitudinal-to-transverse cross-section ratio,  R, and Vector Meson Dominance scaling parameter,  xi<sup>2</sup>, which are consistent with the previous  measurements and the model expectations.",
