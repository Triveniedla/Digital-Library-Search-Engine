  "description_abstract": "In this work we investigate multi-variable Toeplitz operators and their relationship with KK-theory in order to apply this relationship to define and analyze embedded Toeplitz problems. In particular, we study the embedded Toeplitz problem of the unit disk into the unit ball in C^2. The embedding of Toeplitz problems suggests a way to define Toeplitz operators over singular spaces.",
