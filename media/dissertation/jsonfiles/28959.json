Wilson Abstract</title> </head>  <body> Previous research has indicated that there is a  possible relationship between disproportionality in student discipline and high  school dropout rate.Â  Using discipline  and dropout data from a mid-Atlantic state school district, discipline  disproportionality and dropout rate amongst high school African American,  Hispanic, and Caucasian male and females over a period of four school years was  examined. The findings indicated that there was indeed discipline  disproportionality among African American, Hispanic, and Caucasian  students.Â  However, the evidence  indicating a relationship between disproportionality and dropping out was not  conclusive.Â  Based on the findings,  implications for educational practice are advanced.Â  In addition, recommendations for further  research are set forth. </body> </html>",
