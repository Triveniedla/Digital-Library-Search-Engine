  "description_abstract": "This causal comparative study examined the relationship of the school demographic factors of ethnicity, socioeconomic percentages, academic performance, and school location (urban versus rural) on principal leadership with data analyzed when schools were placed into groups ex-post-facto. One-Hundred and sixty-nine teachers representing six public high schools located in Virginia were surveyed using Powell√¢  s (2004) survey. Five areas, or domains of leadership were analyzed, (I) Vision, Mission, and Culture; (II) Curriculum and Classroom Instruction; (III) Collaboration and Shared Leadership; (IV) Family and Community Involvement; (V) Effective Management. Quantitative data were analyzed (means, frequency, ANOVA, Tukey-Kramer HSD) with school results placed into demographic groups and locations to examine group differences in perceptions of principal leadership. Significant differences were found when schools were grouped according to location and demographic factors. A model of the contextual elements on the role of principal leadership was developed, and implications for research and future studies were presented.",
