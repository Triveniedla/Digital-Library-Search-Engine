Hohenshil & Kusum Singh, Co-Chairs Counselor Education <br>     (ABSTRACT) <br></center>      <p><br>   <br>   The Occupational Stress Inventory Revised Edition (OSI-R) and an Individual    Data Form were used to determine the turnover intentions of rehabilitation counselors    based on an interactive model of stress, strain, and coping. Occupational stress,    strain, coping resources, and turnover intentions were examined in relationship    with various demographic variables collected from a national sample of 982 members    of the American Rehabilitation Counselors Association (ARCA). Demographic variables    included age, gender, ethnicity, certification status as a Certified Rehabilitation    Counselor (CRC), years of experience, practice setting, the number of clients    on a counselor's caseload, and the amount of hours worked per week. </p> <p>Data were collected through a mail survey, with a response rate of 67% (N =    657). However, of those respondents only 22% (N=145) had complete data and met    the inclusion criteria. Inclusion criterion consisted of considering oneself    to be employed full-time as a practicing rehabilitation counselor. Based on    the usable data (N=145), respondents were on average 44 years old and Caucasian,    with 63% being female. Over half of the respondents were certified as rehabilitation    counselors, with an average number of nine years of certification. The average    number of years of experience as a rehabilitation counselor was approximately    ten and respondents worked an average of 45 hours per week with an average caseload    size of 88 clients. </p> <p>Path analysis was used to analyze causal relationships among turnover related    variables. The hypothesized model included age, experience, number of clients    on a caseload, occupational stress, strain, coping resources, and turnover intention.    The tested model explained 37.5% of the variance in turnover intentions. The    results suggest that the turnover intentions of rehabilitation counselors is    meaningfully accounted for by variables contained in the model. Occupational    stress produced the largest significant effect (B=.404) and had the most influence    on turnover intentions. This indicates that it is occupational stress inherent    in the job functions of rehabilitation counselors, and not individual coping    resources or demographic variables that account for turnover in the field of    rehabilitation. Therefore rehabilitation agencies should examine the roles that    they place rehabilitation counselors in versus the individual characteristics    of rehabilitation counselors in order to reduce turnover in the field. </p> </body> </html>",
