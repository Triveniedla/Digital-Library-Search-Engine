  "description_abstract": "This dissertation developed a comprehensive model conceptualizing the factors affecting children's choice of influence strategy and relative influence in family consumption decisions.  In particular, the model asserted that antecedent variables (i.e., family variables, individual characteristics of children, individual characteristics of parents, and parent-child interdependence) affect both directly and indirectly children's choice of influence strategy and relative influence.  Process variables (i.e., family socialization and power structure) mediate the effects of the antecedent variables.  In addition, effects of family socialization and power structure on children's choice of influence strategy and subsequent relative influence vary with the product type, decision stage, and subdecision.  Finally, children's relative influence is also dependent on their choice of influence strategy.   An empirical study was advanced to partially test the model.  Specifically, relationships among family socialization, power structure, children's choice of influence strategy, and their relative influence were empirically examined.  A field experimental interaction procedure was designed for data collection from parent/child dyads.  Multiple regressions were conducted to analyze the data.  Results showed moderate support to the hypothesized relationships.  However, most links in the testing model presented significant results.  It appears that the integration of consumer socialization theory and power relational theory provides better explanation to children's influence behavior than either theory does individually.",
