  "description_abstract": "Nearly Euclidean Thurston maps are simple generalizations of rational Lattes maps. A Thurston map is called nearly Euclidean if its local degree at each critical point is 2 and it has exactly four postcritical points. We investigate when such a map has the property that the associated pullback map on Teichmuller space is constant. We also show that no Thurston map of degree 2 has constant pullback map.",
