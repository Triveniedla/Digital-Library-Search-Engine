  "description_abstract": "Abstract  Given that standards are legislated through the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 and the Standards of Learning have been implemented in the Commonwealth of Virginia, educational reforms call for extended learning opportunities and a requirement that leaders implement programs that are scientifically research-based which concentrate on the achievement of all students. Year round education is scientifically research based. The purpose of this study was to compare year round and traditional education at an urban middle school on attendance, academic performance, and behavior patterns. The school had both year round education and traditional education from 1998-2001.  This is a unique factor to this study, as no one has compared year round education and traditional education on attendance, academic performance, and behavior patterns in an urban setting with both year round education and traditional education in the same building.   \tThe population in this quantitative quasi-experimental study was 113 grade 8 year round education (87) and traditional education (26) students from one urban middle school in southeastern Virginia, who had been in the programs for three years (grades 3-6). The over- riding research questions were: (1) does year round education make an impact on attendance as measured by grade 8 attendance data after controlling for initial differences in grade 5 attendance? , (2) does year round education have an impact on academic achievement as measured by the SOL after controlling for grade 5 Degrees of Reading Power (DRP)? , (3) does year round education impact students√¢   behavior patterns as measured by grade 8 out-of-school suspensions (OSS) and in-school-suspensions (SIPS) data?  Two one-way ANCOVAs, two chi squares, and t-tests were conducted to determine the statistical significant differences in attendance, academic performance, and behavior patterns (the first time placements in in-school suspension and out-of school suspension) of year round education and traditional education students with a pre-determined alpha of .05. The results indicated no statistically significant findings. The conclusions and implications in this study were limited by the size of the sample, lack of random student assignment, students interacting with each other, and students having the same teachers. Year round education provides an educational option for students and families.",
