  "description_abstract": "We clear up two issues regarding the eigenvalue problem for the Manakov system; these problems relate directly to the existence of the soliton [\\emph{sic}] effect in fiber optic cables.  The first issue is a bound on the eigenvalues of the Manakov system: \\emph{if} the parameter $\\xi$ is an eigenvalue, \\emph{then} it must lie in a certain region in the complex plane.  The second issue has to do with a chirped Manakov system. We show that if a system is chirped too much, the soliton effect disappears.  While this has been known for some time experimentally, there has not yet been a theoretical result along these lines for the Manakov system.",
