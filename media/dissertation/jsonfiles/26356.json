  "description_abstract": "<p>Benthic macroinvertebrate colonization of twelve O.04-ha experimental ponds was studied for the 1st yr of their existence. The ponds were filled in late January 1988, and artificial substrate samples were retrieved at 4-wk intervals from February 25, 1988 to February 25, 1989. The first organisms (<u>Chironomus</u> and ceratopogonidae) were collected 4 wk after filling. Diptera, p~imarily several genera of chironomids, were followed in coloniz~ng the ponds by Coleoptera, Ephemeroptera, and odonata. The arrival of new taxa corresponded to adult flight periods. Non-insect taxa (oligochaeta, Nematoda, Amphipoda) were collected in relatively low numbers and then only late in the year. A total of 29 taxa were collected, 13 of which were present in all 12 ponds. Mean number of taxa, diversity, and evenness increased rapidly during the first 7 mo but never became very high. Density increased slowly throughout the spring and summer, increased rapidly during the autumn and eventually became quite high.</p>",
