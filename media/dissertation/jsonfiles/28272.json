  "description_abstract": "An instrumented oedometer was designed and constructed for the purpose of investigating at-rest and compaction-induced earth pressures in moist soils. The device has a split oedometer ring, and horizontal stresses are measured using load cells which support one half of the ring. Rapid cyclic loading was applied to compacted soil specimens, using a digital pressure regulator and a computer-based data acquisition system. The performance of the device was validated by performing tests on silicon rubber and Monterey sand.",
