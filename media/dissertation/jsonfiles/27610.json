  "description_abstract": "Recent research on organizational justice suggests  3 elements of process-related justice: procedural, interpersonal, and informational justice. Early  research on the fair process effect indicates that fair procedures in general can help to ameliorate the effects of negative outcomes. This study  examined the relative importance of each specific process element in accounting for the fair  process effect. In addition, this study examined  whether there are substitutable effects among the process elements such that high fairness on one element substitutes for low fairness on another element. Administrative Assistants working at a university read 48 hypothetical profiles describing a supervisor's procedural,interpersonal  and informational justice behaviors in handling a  negative job-related outcome. Administrative  Assistants provided overall judgments of the  fairness of the situation. The policy capturing  analysis indicated that the weights given to the  fairness cues varied somewhat across individuals.  Hierarchical cluster analysis indicated that  participants' fairness policies could be grouped  into 3 homogenous clusters: two \"main effects  clusters\" and an \"interaction cluster.\" The first  main effects cluster equally weighted procedural,  interpersonal and informational justice in their  overall fairness evaluations. The second main  effects cluster favored procedural justice over  the other two forms of justice. Finally,  participants in the interaction cluster utilized  the three two-way interactions between the forms  of justice. Between-subject analyses indicated  that the available demographic and background  variables were not related to the judges'  policies. Research and practical implications  are discussed.",
