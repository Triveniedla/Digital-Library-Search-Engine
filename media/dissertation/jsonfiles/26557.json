  "description_abstract": "This dissertation is a systematic study  of electric power distribution system  reliability evaluation and improvement. Reliability evaluation of electric power systems  has traditionally been an integral part of planning and operation.  Changes in the electric  utility coupled with aging electric apparatus create a need for more realistic techniques  for power system reliability modeling.    This work presents a reliability evaluation technique that combines set theory and  Graph Trace Analysis (GTA). Unlike the traditional Markov approach, this technique  provides a fast solution for large system reliability evaluation by managing computer  memory efficiently with iterators, assuming a single failure at a time. A reconfiguration  for restoration algorithm is also created  to enhance the accuracy of the reliability  evaluation, considering multiple concurrent  failures. As opposed to most restoration  simulation methods used in reliability analysis, which convert restoration problems into  mathematical models and only can solve radial systems, this new algorithm seeks the      reconfiguration solution from topology characteristics of the network itself. As a result  the new reconfiguration algorithm can handle systems with loops.   In analyzing system reliability, this research takes into account time-varying load  patterns, and seeks approaches that are financially justified. An exhaustive search scheme  is used to calculate optimal locations for Distributed Generators (DG) from the reliability  point of view. A Discrete Ascent Optimal Programming (DAOP) load shifting approach  is proposed to provide low cost, reliability improvement solutions.    As weather conditions have an important effect on distribution component failure  rates, the influence of different types of storms has been incorporated into this study.  Storm outage models are created based on ten years√¢   worth of weather and power outage  data. An observer is designed to predict the number of outages for an approaching or on  going storm. A circuit corridor model is applied to investigate the relationship between  power outages and lightning activity.",
