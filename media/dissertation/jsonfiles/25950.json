  "description_abstract": "INTRODUCTION<p> Numerous past reports have mentioned or have been totally concerned with the significance of spermatozoan agglutination following treatment with blood sera, female genital fluids and other biological and synthetic media. Since semen is a colloid (undissolved particles suspended in a suitable medium such as gas, liquid, solid), spermatozoan agglutination should be at least partially definable by physical chemical measurements and should thereby be predicted and controlled...",
