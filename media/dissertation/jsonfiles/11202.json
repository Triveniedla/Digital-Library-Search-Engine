  "description_abstract": "The first objective of this dissertation is to present hybrid numerical-analytical approaches and reduced-order models to   simulate     microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) in multi-physics fields. These include electric actuation (AC and DC), squeeze-film damping, thermoelastic damping, and structural forces. The second objective is to investigate MEMS phenomena, such as squeeze-film damping and dynamic pull-in, and use the latter to design a novel RF-MEMS switch.     In the first part of the dissertation, we  introduce a new approach to the modeling and simulation of flexible microstructures under the coupled effects of squeeze-film damping,  electrostatic actuation, and mechanical forces. The new approach utilizes the compressible Reynolds equation coupled with the equation governing the plate  deflection. The model accounts for the slip condition of the flow at very low pressures. Perturbation methods are used to derive an analytical expression for the pressure distribution in terms of the structural mode shapes. This expression is substituted into the  plate   equation, which is  solved in turn  using a finite-element method  for the structural mode shapes, the pressure distributions, the natural frequencies, and the quality factors. We apply the new approach to a variety of rectangular and  circular plates and  present the final expressions for the pressure distributions and  quality factors. We extend the approach to microplates actuated by large electrostatic forces. For this case,  we present a low-order model, which reduces significantly  the cost  of simulation.  The model utilizes the nonlinear  Euler-Bernoulli beam equation, the von K´arm´an plate  equations, and   the  compressible Reynolds equation.     The second topic of the dissertation is thermoelastic damping. We present a model  and analytical expressions for thermoelastic damping in   microplates. We solve the heat equation for the thermal flux across the  microplate, in terms of the structural mode shapes, and hence decouple the thermal equation from the plate equation. We utilize a perturbation method to derive an analytical expression for the quality factor of  a microplate with general boundary conditions  under electrostatic loading and residual stresses in terms of its structural mode shapes.  We present  results for microplates with various boundary conditions.    In the final part of the dissertation, we present a dynamic analysis and simulation of  MEMS resonators and novel RF MEMS switches employing resonant microbeams. We first study microbeams excited near   their fundamental natural frequencies (primary-resonance excitation). We investigate  the dynamic  pull-in instability and formulate  safety criteria for the design of  MEMS sensors and RF  filters. We also  utilize this  phenomenon to design a low-voltage RF MEMS switch actuated with a combined DC and AC loading. Then, we  simulate the dynamics of microbeams excited near half their fundamental natural frequencies (superharmonic excitation) and  twice their fundamental natural frequencies (subharmonic excitation). For the superharmonic case, we present results showing the effect of varying the   DC bias, the damping, and the AC excitation amplitude  on the frequency-response curves.   For the subharmonic case, we show that if the magnitude of the AC forcing exceeds the threshold activating the  subharmonic resonance,  all frequency-response curves will reach pull-in.",
