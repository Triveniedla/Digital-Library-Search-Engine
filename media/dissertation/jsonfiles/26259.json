  "description_abstract": "The purpose of this study is to examine the issue of planning for technology in existing, new, or renovated school facilities. The focus is to provide educators a technology profile to help with planning issues regarding school design and the integration of technology in school facilities. Very few counties in the Commonwealth of Virginia have a facility planner on staff. It is the intent of this author to provide support for those involved with planning for technology in school facilities. Principals can use this tool to help align school technology goals with the division long-term plan as well as the technology standards. Reviewing the components of the Virginia Educational Technology Alignment Report, the CEO Forum STAR indicators, the Florida Technology Resource Survey, as well as the TAGLIT survey tool provided insight to the technology profile. This tool was used throughout the Commonwealth of Virginia to assess current conditions and the perceptions of principals, teachers and division support staff in an attempt to assess current and long-range planning for technology in school facilities.     The literature reviewed clearly identifies that a continued commitment to long-range planning and effective statewide integration of educational technology into teaching and learning is essential. A close examination of the results of this study will assist those planning for and assessing schools readiness for technology and its impact on school design to ensure the accommodation of future technological needs of school facilities.  \tAs a result of the data collected a user technology profile can be created for each participating school. This tool can help in a variety of ways. Possibilities include setting benchmarks and goals, applying for technology grants, determining funding priorities, and creating individualized assessment tools. The intent here is to provide a technology user profile for each school by participant. This would enable the principal to review the data separately or by comparison of principal and teacher.",
