  "description_abstract": "The relationships between student achievement and a number of variables relating to  building and classroom conditions in Virginia elementary schools were examined.  A  systematic random sample of 300 schools was selected from all elementary schools in  Virginia with grades three and five.  Data on building condition, classroom condition, and  demographics were collected with \"An Assessment of Building and Classroom Conditions  in Elementary Schools in Virginia.\"  Building principals completed the survey.  The scaled  scores from the Spring 1998 Standards of Learning Assessments for third-grade English,  fifth-grade English, third-grade mathematics, and fifth-grade mathematics were used as  measures of student achievement. The percentage passing the fifth-grade technology  assessment was used as a measure of achievement in technology as scaled scores were not  available. Findings         A large portion of Virginia elementary schools are more than thirty years old and  have a number of structural and classroom defects.  While principals gave high composite  ratings to their schools, their responses to individual questions indicate problems with roof  leaks and climate control.           The percentage of students participating in the free and reduced-price lunch program  accounted for the largest percentages of variance in English, math, and technology  achievement.  However, this variable had greater influence on achievement in English and  technology than in mathematics.  Air conditioning was a significant variable in third-grade  English, fifth-grade mathematics, and fifth-grade technology achievement.  Other variables  found significant in one or more of the analyses were ceiling type, frequency of floor  sweeping, frequency of floor mopping, connection to a wide-area network, room structure,  overall building maintenance, and flooring type.",
