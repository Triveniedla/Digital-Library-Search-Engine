  "description_abstract": "No-till management for agronomic crop production is recognized as an effective practice to regain a portion of soil organic matter lost following decades of cultivation. Increasing soil organic matter sequesters C, conserves organic N and concomitantly improves soil quality. Objectives of this research were to: i) quantify C sequestration rate and N conservation with duration of continuous no-till; ii) measure C stratification with continuous no-till as an indicator of soil quality; and iii) evaluate the Illinois soil N test (ISNT) for its value to predict fertilizer N needs of corn in Virginia. Objectives i and ii were achieved by collecting soil samples from 63 production fields in the Virginia Coastal Plain that were managed using continuous no-till from 0 to 14 yrs. No-till management resulted in sequestration of 0.308 Â± 0.280 Mg C ha-1 yr-1 and conservation of 22.2 Â± 21.2 kg N ha-1 yr-1 (0-15 cm). The C stratification ratio (0-2.5 cm: 7.5-15 cm) increased with increasing duration of continuous no-till (0.133 Â± 0.056 yr-1) due to the accumulation of organic matter at the soil surface indicating improved soil quality with continuous no-till management.  Objective iii was addressed by conducting 29 on-farm fertilizer N response trials in major corn producing areas of Virginia with the duration of continuous no-till management ranging from 0 to 25 yrs. The ISNT values were significantly related to yield without fertilizer N (r2 = 0.57; p<0.001) and relative yield (r2 = 0.64; p<0.0001). We also found that the ISNT extracted a relatively consistent percentage of total soil N (16.3 Â± 0.73 %) suggesting it is a poor indicator of labile N. Total soil N values did almost as well as the ISNT in predicting yield without fertilizer N (r2 = 0.53; p = 0.0002), and equally well predicting relative yield (r2 = 0.64; p<0.0001). Results do not suggest the ISNT is useful for measuring mineralizalbe N or improving fertilizer N recommendations in Virginia cropping systems.",
