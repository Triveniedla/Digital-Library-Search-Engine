  "description_abstract": "Linking the structure of a system with its dynamics is an important problem in the theory  of finite dynamical systems.   For monomial dynamical systems, that is, a system that can be described by monomials,  information about the limit cycles can be obtained from the monomials themselves. In particular, this work contains sufficient and necessary conditions for a  monomial dynamical system to have only fixed points as limit cycles.",
