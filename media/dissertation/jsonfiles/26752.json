  "description_abstract": "The studyâ  s purpose was to determine the job satisfaction level of Virginia Soil and Water Conservation District (SWCD) employees during fiscal year 2007-2008. Employee characteristics were identified; three measures of job satisfaction were attained (intrinsic, extrinsic, general satisfaction); and satisfaction levels on 12 specific job aspects were determined. The relationship between job satisfaction and four independent variables (age, gender, education level, primary job responsibility) was assessed. The instrument consisted of an employee characteristics survey, the Minnesota Satisfaction Questionnaire (MSQ) 1977 Short-Form, derived from the MSQ 1967 Long-Form (Weiss, Dawis, England, & Lofquist, 1967), and a modified 2002 Virginia Association of Soil and Water Conservation Districts (VASWCD) survey. Descriptive research statistics were utilized. A total of 185 employees participated, which was an 80% response rate.   The majority of employees were characterized as: non-Hispanic, white, female, average age 41 years, married with no children 18 and under living in the home, bachelorâ  s degree, average tenure of 6.52 years, full-time, permanent position, average hourly wage of $14.45 and annual salary of $36,373.54, primary job responsibility â  technical.â    The MSQ found respondents generally and intrinsically satisfied. Greater satisfaction was expressed for variety and social services. Overall respondents were undecided about extrinsic job aspects. Advancement was an area of dissatisfaction.    The modified VASWCD survey found respondents satisfied overall. Respondents were â  very satisfiedâ   with work schedule, type of work, and board relationships. Employees were less satisfied with health insurance benefits, new employee orientation, and compensation. They were â  dissatisfiedâ   with career advancement opportunities and life insurance.  Differences in total intrinsic, extrinsic, and general job satisfaction, as measured by the MSQ, based on the independent variables were determined. A one-way ANOVA and Tukeyâ  s post-hoc test were utilized. Since the population of this study violated Leveneâ  s Test of Homogeneity, the ANOVA could not be performed for age and intrinsic and general job satisfaction. The ANOVA was performed for all other variables. There was not a significant difference in extrinsic satisfaction among respondents of the various age groups. There were no significant differences in intrinsic, extrinsic, or general job satisfaction for the variables of gender, education level, or primary job responsibility.",
