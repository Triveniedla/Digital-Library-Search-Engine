  "description_abstract": "<p>This study was conducted to investigate the effects of a four component worksite wellness program on elementary public school teachers and staff members. Fifty-nine volunteers from one elementary school were divided into two groups depending on their availability for participation in either a fall or spring twelve week wellness program. The four intervention components were aerobics, health-related seminars, health-related pamphlets and handouts, and the Governor's (Virginia) Physical Fitness Award Program for School Personnel.</p> <p>The dependent variable measures for mental well-being included: the General Well-Being Schedule; the Trait Anxiety Subscale of the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory; and the Brayfield and Rothe Job Satisfaction Index. The following physiological measures were recorded for physical well-being: resting blood pressure, resting heart rate, and skinfold calibrations.</p>",
