  "description_abstract": "The taxonomy of species in the genus <i>Cerococcus</i> has been unstable and adequate keys and descriptions have not been available for identification. This detailed study of the first instars is one step in the revision of the genus and reevaluation of the taxa which have been referred to the genus. <p>The first instars of 31 species of <i>Cerococcus</i> are included in this study. Each species studied is fully described, including measurements of morphological characters, and illustrated. <p><i>Cerococcus</i> first instars were found to have well developed legs; well developed mouthparts with a 3-segmented labium; 6-segmented antennae; 2 pairs of spiracles with associated quinquelocular pores; acornshaped spiracular setae or regular setae-shaped spiracular setae; well developed anal lobes which are armed with spines on the inner margin and terminated by long apical setae; large conspicuous dorsal B-shaped pores in longitudinal rows; dorsal trapezoid-shaped anal plate; and 6 setae on the anal ring. <p>The classification of <i>Cerococcus</i> first instars generally agreed with the classification of the adult females, and keys are provided for separation of the first instars studied. <p>Species of the genus <i>Cerococcus</i> were found to be morphologically distinct from the species in the genera <i>Asterococcus</i> and <i>Solenophora</i>. It appears that the genus <i>Cerococcus</i> is only distantly related to the genera in the families <i>Asterolecaniidae, Eriococcidae</i>, and <i>Lecanodiaspidiae</i>.",
