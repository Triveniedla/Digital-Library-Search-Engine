  "description_abstract": "Implementation of affirmative action policies at doctorate-granting universities was examined using quantitative and qualitative research methods. The first phase included a quantitative assessment of the collective and individual progress made in hiring and promoting women faculty during the 1970s. Institutional data reported in the annual Higher Education General Information Survey were used to construct an index reflecting the degree of change experienced by the institution in five areas. After institutions were rank ordered on the basis of their composite change score, three of the most successful were selected for site visits.",
