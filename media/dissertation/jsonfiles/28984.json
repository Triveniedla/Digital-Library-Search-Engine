  "description_abstract": "The main limitations in performing uncertainty analysis of CFD models using conventional methods are associated with cost and effort. For these reasons, there is a need for the development and implementation of efficient stochastic CFD tools for performing uncertainty analysis. One of the main contributions of this research is the development and implementation of Intrusive and Non-Intrusive methods using polynomial chaos for uncertainty representation and propagation. In addition, a methodology was developed to address and quantify turbulence model uncertainty. In this methodology, a complex perturbation is applied to the incoming turbulence and closure coefficients of a turbulence model to obtain the sensitivity derivatives, which are used in concert with the polynomial chaos method for uncertainty propagation of the turbulence model outputs.",
