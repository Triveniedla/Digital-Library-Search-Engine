  "description_abstract": "A new unsteady rotor/fuselage interactional aerodynamics model has been developed. This model loosely couples a Generalized  Dynamic Wake Theory (GDWT) to a Navier-Stokes solution procedure. This coupling is achieved using a newly developed unsteady pressure jump boundary condition in the Navier-Stokes model. The new unsteady pressure jump boundary condition models each rotor blade as a moving pressure jump which travels around the rotor azimuth and is applied between two adjacent planes in a cylindrical,  non-rotating grid. Comparisons are made between predictions using  this new model and experiments for an isolated rotor and  for a coupled rotor/fuselage configuration.",
