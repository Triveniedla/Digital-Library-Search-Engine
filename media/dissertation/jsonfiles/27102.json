  "description_abstract": "This study investigated the impact of Virginia√¢  s K-3 Primary Class Size Reduction Program on student achievement in reading.  The theoretical framework hypothesized that a reduction in class size and sustained professional development would impact instructional strategies implemented by teachers which would result in increased reading achievement by students.  Information regarding the history of class size research was presented to provide readers with a chronological overview of the topic.  In addition, statewide class size reduction initiatives from Indiana, Tennessee, Wisconsin, and California were reviewed.  Data were collected using administrator and teacher surveys as well as an analysis of the Virginia Standards of Learning Assessments for Grade 3 English and the Phonological Awareness Literacy Screening (PALS) results for schools participating in the research study.  The findings revealed that the Virginia K-3 Primary Class Size Reduction Program benefited grade 3 students according to gender, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status. <p><i>Vita removed at the author's request.
