  "description_abstract": "This dissertation contains two parts: Commutative and Noncommutative Multidimensional ($d$-D) Linear Systems Theory.   The first part  focuses on the development of the interpolation theory to solve the $H^{\\infty}$ control problem for $d$-D linear systems.   We first review the classical discrete-time 1D linear system in the operator theoretical viewpoint followed by the formulations of the so-called Givone-Roesser and Fornasini-Marchesini models.    Application of the $d$-variable $Z$-transform to the system of equations yields the transfer function which is a rational function of several complex variables, say $\\mathbf{z} = (z_{1}, \\dots, z_{d})$. <p> We then consider the output feedback stabilization problem for a plant $P(\\mathbf{z})$. By assuming that  $P(\\mathbf{z})$ admits a double coprime factorization, then a set of stabilizing controllers $K(\\mathbf{z})$ can be parametrized by the Youla parameter $Q(\\mathbf{z})$.   By doing so, one can convert such a problem to the model matching problem with performance index $F(\\mathbf{z})$, affine in $Q(\\mathbf{z})$.  Then, with $F(\\mathbf{z})$ as the design parameter rather than $Q(\\mathbf{z})$, one has an interpolation problem for $F(\\mathbf{z})$.   Incorporation of a tolerance level on $F(\\mathbf{z})$ then leads to an interpolation problem of multivariable Nevanlinna-Pick type.  We also give an operator-theoretic formulation of the model matching problem which lends itself to a solution via the commutant lifting theorem on the polydisk.   <p> The second part  details a system whose time-axis is described by  a free semigroup $\\mathcal{F}_{d}$.  Such a system can be represented by the so-called noncommutative Givone-Roesser, or noncommutative Fornasini-Marchesini models  which are analogous to those in the first part. Application of a noncommutative $d$-variable $Z$-transform to the system of equations yields the transfer function expressed by a formal power series in several noncommuting indeterminants, say $T(z) = \\sum_{v \\in \\mathcal{F}_{d}}T_{v}z^{v}$ where $z^{v} = z_{i_{n}} \\dotsm z_{i_{1}}$ if $v = g_{i_{n}} \\dotsm g_{i_{1}} \\in \\mathcal{F}_{d}$ and $z_{i}z_{j} \\neq z_{j}z_{i}$ unless $i = j$.   The concepts of reachability, controllability, observability, similarity, and stability are introduced by means of the state-space interpretation.  Minimal realization problems for noncommutative Givone-Roesser or Fornasini-Marchesini systems are solved directly by a shift-realization procedure constructed from appropriate noncommutative Hankel matrices. This procedure adapts the ideas of SchÃ¼tzenberger and Fliess originally developed for \"recognizable series\" to our systems.",
