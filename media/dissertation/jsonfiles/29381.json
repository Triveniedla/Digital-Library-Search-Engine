  "description_abstract": "This study examined an innovative,       project-based curriculum in a freshman biology       laboratory by focusing on how students       developed their conceptual understanding of a       biological species. A model for learning was       posed based on learners working in small       groups. This model linked a socio-cultural       approach to teaching and learning to       conceptual change theory. Qualitative research       methods were employed to collect a variety of       data. Documentation of this innovative       curriculum is provided. This investigative       curriculum incorporated the research practices       that scientists use. A wide range of dynamic       interactions with students actively investigating       problems and sharing both their findings and       thoughts during this time occurred. This       essentially modeled the authentic practices of       scientists. A direct comparison was made with       this learning environment and the model for       learning. Peer tutoring, cooperative learning,       and most importantly, peer collaboration were       observed when students grappled with difficult       problems for which there was no single right       answer. Teachers served as guides in learning,       shifting responsibility to the students. Analysis       of student writing revealed richer, more       complex definitions of species after the       experience of the laboratory project. Several       of the students used knowledge gained directly       from their experiences during the laboratory       project to help elaborate their definitions. The       electronic discussions showed a range of social       interactions and interactivity. High quality       discussions were found to be rich in scientific       thought, engaging discussants by offering       information, questioning, and actively       hypothesizing. Mediating and facilitating       discussions by the participants was found to be       an important factor in their success. Groups       exhibiting high quality discussions also had a       lower response time than other groups,       indicating that more substantive dialogues       which are rich in thought proceed at a slower       pace. Significantly, an important connection       has been made between the socio-cultural       approach to learning and conceptual change       theory. A closer examination of how small       groups of learners develop conceptual       understanding is needed. This approach also       needs to be extended into other settings where       reform in science education is taking place.",
