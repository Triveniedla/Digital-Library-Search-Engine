  "description_abstract": "The objective of the thesis is to introduce a new fuzzy logic control application, develop the associated mathematical theory and prove the concept and its advantages through comparative simulation with existing, classical, methods.  A stable fuzzy logic controller for the master-slave current sharing loop of a paralleled DC-DC system is presented that exhibits a considerably improved large signal performance over the presently employed, small signal designed compensators, both in terms of system response and control effort.  Because of high system complexity, the present small signal designs are unable to give a good response for large load changes and line transients.  Fuzzy logic, by dealing naturally with nonlinearities, offers a superior controller type, for this type of applications.  The design uses a PID expert to derive the fuzzy inference rules, and simulation results show a good parameter insensitive transient response over a wide range load-step responses, e.g., from 25% to 75% of the nominal load.  Current sharing control is formulated as a tracking problem and stability is ensured through adaptation or supervisory control on a Lyapunov trajectory.  The technique benefits also from the heuristic approach to the problem that overcomes the complexity in modeling such systems and, hence, offers a practical engineering tool, amenable to both analog and digital implementations.",
