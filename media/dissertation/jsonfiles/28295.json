  "description_abstract": "Meeting the Demands of Modern Governance: The Administrative Thought of Supreme Court Justice Byron White  John M. Aughenbaugh  Abstract   \tThis dissertation examines the administrative principles found in retired Supreme Court Justice Byron Whiteâ  s administrative law case opinions.  The purposes of the dissertation are to explore and identify the dominant themes found in Whiteâ  s administrative law opinions and to discover what public administration can learn from a Supreme Court justice who took more than a passing interest in governance matters.  \tThis study has the following research expectations: \t â ¢\tThere is an identifiable White administrative law jurisprudence; â ¢\tWithin this jurisprudence, there are principles that recognize and are sensitive to the demands of modern governance; and â ¢\tWhiteâ  s administrative thought can be translated and used by public administrators to guide and instruct their work.  \tThe first part of the dissertation is descriptive as the dominant themes in Whiteâ  s administrative law jurisprudence are identified and examined.  Standard case briefing analysis is used for this exploration.    The second half of the project is normative, wherein Rohrâ  s â  regime valuesâ   framework is used to explore what public administrators may learn from studying Whiteâ  s administrative law opinions.  Moreover, this section of the dissertation will explore the extent to which Whiteâ  s conception of modern governance incorporates what scholars have referred to as the judicialization of the modern administrative state by the federal courts and what is Whiteâ  s conception of a constitutionally competent civil servant.",
