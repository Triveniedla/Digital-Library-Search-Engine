  "description_abstract": "<p>This study is a synthesis of the research since 1980 pertaining to the relationships between school facilities and student achievement and school facilities and student behavior. A matrix was developed relevant to the research. This matrix was used to identify not only the researchers and the areas in which the research was conducted, but also the areas in which there was no available research. The former is important to the educator and school designer; the latter is essential for future researchers.</p> <p> Fifty-three studies were synthesized that included the independent variables of noise, facility age, color, lighting, maintenance, density, climate conditions, and classroom structure. From the research reviewed, educators and designers should consider the impact of building condition, lighting, and site noise when planning, remodeling, designing, or maintaining schools, as there was conclusive evidence that the effects of these three variables on student achievement and behavior were significant. Although not conclusive, data from the studies indicated that all of the independent variables affected the dependent variables of student achievement and behavior.</p>",
