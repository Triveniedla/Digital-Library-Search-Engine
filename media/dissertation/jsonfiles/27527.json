  "description_abstract": "This research explores the experiences and attitudes of nine full-time students with disabilities at Virginia Tech who choose to conceal their identity as individuals with disabilities in various contexts. The definition of disability is expanded to include those individuals who perceive themselves to be disabled, with or without meeting diagnostic or legal criteria, since many of those who conceal their differences may choose not to pursue such forms of official classification and identification. In a series of interviews, participants provide insight into their experiences, labels and discourse that have shaped those experiences, and outcomes of identification as individuals with disabilities. A variety of themes emerging from the interviews, under the categories of experiences, labels and discourse, and outcomes of disability, are analyzed and discussed.  This research aims to explore and develop a greater understanding of these individuals and what their stories have to offer through an emic perspective.",
