  "description_abstract": "The purpose of this project was to augment self-efficacy, outcome expectations, and self-regulatory skills for women with breast cancer through a quality of life intervention based on Social Cognitive Theory. Relationships between social cognitive variables, positive coping behaviors, and quality of life were explored. The intervention was conducted in collaboration with an established cancer treatment center and provided information, guided feedback, and mastery experiences in a supportive environment for breast cancer survivors. A total of 32 women were enrolled and randomized to either the 8-week intervention or standard-care. With a final n of 14, the lack of statistical power made it difficult to determine whether differences existed between the two groups. Data trends suggested that some women benefited from the program. Implications for the content and delivery of future psychosocial interventions with cancer patients were discussed.",
