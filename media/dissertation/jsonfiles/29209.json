  "description_abstract": "In addition to being useful for some nondestructive evaluation techniques, interactions between magnetic fields and defects in solids may also alter material properties.  To explore this possibility, Maxwell√¢  s equations were coupled with a continuum mechanics model for elastic strain to formulate analytical expressions for the interaction of a magnetic field with several crack geometries. The influence of crack velocity and a realistic (nonlinear) magnetic susceptibility were included into a model of this type for the first time and shown to introduce unexpected trends in the magneto-elastic stress intensity.  Singularities magneto-elastic stresses appear at different combinations of magnetic field strength and crack velocity, and the stresses at the crack tip switch sign.    In a related study, the interaction of an alternating magnetic field with elastic stress through was explored through a coupling effect known as magneto-acoustic resonance.  A model for the phenomena, in which magnetic waves excite elastic waves and vice versa, was formulated and used to explore the spin (magnon) and anti-plane elastic (phonon) interactions in piecewise homogeneous ferromagnetic spaces with two different sets of properties. The model suggests some combinations of magnetic field and frequency can produce a new kind of wave to appear.  These new waves, which we call Accompanying Surface Magnetoelastic (ASM) waves, are localized at the interface between the two ferromagnetic media and they accompany reflection and transmission waves. It is shown that the amplitudes of the reflected, transmitted, and ASM waves depend strongly on magnetic field strength, frequency, and the angle of the incident wave, as well as on the physical properties of ferromagnetic media.",
