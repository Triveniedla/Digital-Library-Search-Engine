  "description_abstract": "<html> <head> <title>Cathy Stowers Abstract</title> <meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=iso-8859-1\"> </head>  <body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\"> <p>The purpose of this study was to investigate post-secondary students' perceptions    of the role and functions of their high school counselor. One hundred seventy-three    students currently attending a community college in a suburban area of a large    metropolitan city participated in this study. The participants were asked to    complete a survey developed by the researcher. Five research questions (listed    below) guided this study. </p> <p>1) Do post-secondary students perceive that high school counselors are performing    the functions outlined by the American School Counselor Association (see Appendix    B and C), and are there gender and ethnic differences? </p> <p>2) How are perceptions of services rated as \"very\" important by post-secondary    students, and are there gender and ethnic differences? </p> <p>3) How are perceptions of services rated as \"often\" performed by post-secondary    students, and are there gender and ethnic differences? </p> <p>4) What are post-secondary student's perceptions of the importance with which    specific counseling functions are performed as compared to perceptions of frequency?  </p> <p>5) What is the level of unmet need for counseling services perceived as \"very\"    important by post-secondary students? </p> <p>The results indicated that only two percent of high school counselors performed    all functions identified on the questionnaire, however the majority of participants    indicated counselors performed nearly one-third of the functions. The functions    were noted as academic, career, or personal/social domain. The most important    function and the most often performed function rated by participants was discussing    graduation requirements and the least important as well as the least performed    function was identified as assistance with relationship issues. In general,    there was not a significant difference between gender and ethnicity. The percentage    of participants who indicated a function was \"very\" important, however was \"seldom\"    or \"never\" performed was above 50% for most functions. </p> </body> </html>",
