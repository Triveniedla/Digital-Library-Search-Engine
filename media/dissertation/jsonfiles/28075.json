  "description_abstract": "The purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence of known risk factors associated with diabetes among James Moody Adams (JMA) clinic patients in order to develop and test educational material and clinical interventions to reduce the incidence of pre-diabetes and uncontrolled Type II Diabetes.  The research objectives for this study focused on: 1. prevalence of Type II Diabetic patients at the Clinic; 2. pre- and post-test knowledge level of patients regarding their Type II Diabetes; 3. relationship between dependent variables (body mass index [BMI], blood glucose level, blood pressure, waist circumference, level of tobacco use, and level of depression) and the independent variables (age, gender, family history of diabetes, socio-demographical data [education level, level of income], literacy, and exercise regimen, medication, and diabetes knowledge); 4. effectiveness of a nutritional and lifestyle modification intervention program to control Type II Diabetes.  Two hypotheses tests: 1. decrease blood glucose levels of Type II Diabetes Mellitus patients; 2.  decrease weight by 5 percent among pre-diabetic and Type II Diabetes Mellitus patients. A follow-up survey determined participant√¢  s reflection on key dimensions of the study and impact of unforeseen political unrest that occurred during this study. The methodology was a case study with clinical and educational intervention across a 6 months. The population included patients presenting at the JMA clinic at onset of the study; an initial sample of 96 reduced to 48 due in part to political unrest was still within power test specification. Instrumentation include researcher developed, standard of care clinical practice and standardized forms. Analyses utilized descriptive statistics and t-test. Significant gain was determined for diabetic knowledge (p < 0.001); and significant decrease in Type II Diabetic blood glucose with p = 0.031. An important conclusion is that implementing a Type II Diabetic prevention program is feasible and effective in this study. Future recommendations include replication of the study and implementation of protocols and education that were successful in this study.",
