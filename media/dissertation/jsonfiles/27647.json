  "description_abstract": "Mature field-grown apple trees were used to gain a better understanding of the influences of light and fruit on leaf physiology. Light effects on net photosynthesis (Pn), specific leaf weight (SLW), leaf N content (Weight/area) (Nw), and leaf N concentration (% dry weight) (Np) of spur leaves from two canopy locations were evaluated on four dates in 1987. Interior leaves had lower Pn, SLW, Nw, and Np than exterior leaves. In 1988 the influence of %available photosynthetic photon flux (PPF) on the same parameters was examined throughout the season. On most measurement dates both Pn and SLW increased quadratically while Nw increased linearly with increasing PPF. In both years positive linear relationships existed between Pn and Nw, SLW and Nw, and Pn and SLW.",
