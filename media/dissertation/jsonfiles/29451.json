  "description_abstract": "There is a significant amount of literature on needs assessment group processes and distance learning. There is practically no literature on the affects of using distance learning technologies to facilitate needs assessment processes. This study takes a look at the participation of professionals in a needs assessment using distance learning technologies, the affect it has on their communication anxiety in small group settings using the Communication Anxiety Inventory, and their impressions of the process.  Participants used a computer with internet connection and a telephone to take part in the assessment. Three small group needs assessments were conducted. Participants were administered a survey that measured their trait (typical) anxiety score, conducted through the needs assessment, and were administered a survey that measured their state (actual) anxiety score during the assessment and their impressions of the process. Those with low trait anxiety tended to experience an increase in anxiety in this environment while those with high trait anxiety had a decrease in anxiety. It was inconclusive as to whether or not anxiety was a factor in participants contributions to the group process.  All participants were willing to participate in this type of needs assessment again. They found the assessment outcomes valuable and the method in which it was conducted convenient. This would seem to indicate that participants felt the impact of using 2-way audio and distance learning tools was minimal but a larger and more diverse study is necessary in order to make any generalizations.",
