  "description_abstract": "The effects of shock wave impact on unsteady turbine heat transfer are investigated. A numerical approach is developed to simulate the flow physics present in a previously performed unsteady wind tunnel experiment.  The windtunnel experiment included unheated and heated flows over a cascade of highly loaded turbine blades. After the flow over the blades was established, a single shock with a pressure ratio of 1.1 was introduced into the wind tunnel test section. A single blade was equipped with pressure transducers and heat flux microsensors. As the shock wave strikes the blade, time resolved pressure, temperature, and heat transfer  data were recorded.",
