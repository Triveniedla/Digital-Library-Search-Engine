  "description_abstract": "Theoretical tensions between theories of saturation, bonding and leisure were explored from feminist perspectives. Saturation defined by Gergen as a state of relational overload, may cause I of connection between family members. Leisure scholars suggets that bonding occurs during leisure, and a feminist perspective emphasizes that leisure includes conflict and inequality families. Participants were primarily White, and all were uppermiddle class married couples with children aged 6 to 12. Individual and family interviews were held with parents and children. Data was analyzed qualitatively according to strauss and Corbin's (1990) grounded theory procedures.",
