  "description_abstract": "In order to understand biochemical networks we need to know not only how their parts  work but also how they interact with each other. The goal of systems biology is to look  at biological systems as a whole to understand how interactions of the parts can give rise  to complex dynamics. In order to do this efficiently, new techniques have to be developed.  This work shows how tools from mathematics are suitable to study problems in systems  biology such as modeling, dynamics prediction, reverse engineering and many others. The  advantage of using mathematical tools is that there is a large number of theory, algorithms  and software available. This work focuses on how algebra can contribute to answer questions  arising from systems biology.",
