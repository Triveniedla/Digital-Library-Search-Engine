  "description_abstract": "<p>This dissertation is an industry study of college athletics. The introductory chapter details the specific questions this study addresses and contrasts the possible explanations for the organization of intercollegiate athletics. The second, third, fourth, and fifth chapters trace the history of the NCAA. Based on the wealth of evidence presented the fifth chapter concludes that cartel theory offers the most plausible explanation for the actions of the NCAA.</p><p> Given that cartel theory provides the best explanation for intercollegiate athletics, the sixth chapter examines the internal functioning of the NCAA and explores the actions an efficient cartel monitor should undertake to ensure the limiting agreements are followed. The seventh chapter details the legal issues and resulting economic implications that pertain to intercollegiate athletics. The last chapter summarizes and highlights the major results of this dissertation.</p>",
